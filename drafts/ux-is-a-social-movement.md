User Experience (UX) is a social movement is because it sees user needs as equally important as or more important than business needs. Put another way, it is less selfish than the traditional way we think about business. This claim is too abstract to be convincing as its own, so let's dig in.

UX was brought to wider knowledge by Donald Normal in the 1990s.[1] The Wikipedia definition of UX is too fluffy for my taste: phrases like "a person's emotions about using a product" and "perceptions of the practical aspects" makes it sound like UX deals only with surface-level virtues like aesthetics. Further, these are qualities that can be achieved through deception: taking a bad product and manipulating perceptions of it is not UX.

Jesse James Garett does an excellent job clarifying the scope of the field in his book [The Elements of User Experience](http://www.jjg.net/elements/). This famous diagram acts as a summary of the book:

(jjg diagram here)

Consider the bottom of this diagram, the abstract, conceptual tier of "User Needs" and "Site Objectives". I often describe this tier with a venn diagram:

(venn diagram here)

At the conception of a product, business, or perhaps any venture, one could consider this diagram and perform the following thought experiment: How large are each of these circles? How much overlap is there? Already, the UX of the venture is being shaped. If there is little or no overlap, or if few or no user needs are being considered, the UX of the venture is sure to be poor.

I start many of my consulting projects at [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com) with this thought experiment. Not because I think our clients are likely to fail the test (we wouldn't work with them if we thought they did!), or had not thought about this before, but because I need to understand their venture on this level. It should inform all work that is done from that point on. Down the line, when writing functional specifications, every functional unit can be seen as essential or nonessential based on the user needs and business objectives. An after that, every step of the process informs the next. Every detail should be traceable back to this first expression of needs and objetives.

This is my working definition of UX, then: a process for assuring that every detail of a project meets user needs as well as business objectives.

notes from http://vimeo.com/43703770

Here are the notes I took while watching it:

The rich don't want money: they want more money. This is because passion for money is an abstract passion, not a passion as a means to do something.

The dominant fictions in the capitalist world are related to the domination of money; they are fictions of "abstract passion" aka unlimited desire.

The great challenge and responsibility for contemporary artists is to propose new fictions.

"I would propose some kind of universal friendship."

"...the amount of things that a person accumulates and never uses is enormous"

We can solve the problem of non-monetary exchanges on a large scale.

Change the passion of humanity from accumulation and competition to creation and invention
