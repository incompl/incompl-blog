I've often wondered what it looks like when a completely unknown site enjoys some social media popularity.  So when my one-night project <a href="http://jsregex.com">jsregex</a> was on its way to the <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a> front page, I threw some analytics on there to see what happens.  If you're curious too, here is the data.

This is for a site that received 269 points (413 up, 144 down) and had no prior traffic.

<img class="size-full wp-image-211" title="jsranalytics" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/jsranalytics.png" alt="Unique Visitors per Day" width="212" height="127" />

Unique Visitors per Day

That sums up to about 17,000 visitors, while still receiving a few hundred per day.

I also have analytics on this blog, which was discreetly linked to from jsregex.  This site receives almost no traffic, and is only occasionally perused by some of my friends.  Here is the data:

<img class="size-full wp-image-212" title="incomplanalytics" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/incomplanalytics.png" alt="Unique Visits per Day" width="207" height="125" />

Unique Visitors per Day

Still a fairly small number: looks like roughly 0.3% of visitors clicked through to my blog.

Of course, I also have <a href="http://feedburner.com">feedburner</a>:

<img class="size-full wp-image-213" title="incomplfb" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/incomplfb.png" alt="RSS Subscribers per Day" width="172" height="120" />

RSS Subscribers per Day

So roughly 13% of visitors to this blog went on to subscribe via RSS.  That is actually fairly good.  It probably helped that my most recent article was JavaScript related. [Edit: Later data showed about double what is shown here]

So now I know.  It was also fairly fun going through the referrals and finding all kinds of interesting sites, from social media mashups, to blogs in Japanese, Spanish, and other languages, to rip-offs of major sites like <a href="http://popurls.com">popurls</a>.

And if you're one of those new subscribers: hello there!  I hope you find something interesting here from time to time.
