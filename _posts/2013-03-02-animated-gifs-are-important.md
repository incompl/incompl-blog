Before we start, watch that animation off to the right there. Or maybe you already watched it before you started reading? This one always makes me smile. It's [also on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdrY7kXv7Bg) if you're interested, with the title "Alaskan Klee Kai Puppy Freaks Out Over Lime". It has over 1.5 million views and is 52 seconds long. It's kind of nice, though, that you were able to enjoy the experience in the time it takes to load YouTube, read the title, and skip the ad, not including the 23 seconds it takes to get to the good part. You even got to pass on the annoying music, weird human grunting, advertisement partially covering the content, and user annotations partially covering the content.

Animated gifs live in the moment. They finish before you can even realize you're watching. There is a certain purity to that.

What makes animated gifs so special, decades after their invention? Will they survive any longer? Let's discuss.

## Technology

From a technology perspective, animated gifs are just a series of frames that follow one another. Most video formats are far more sophisticated than that: if you want to have a 30 minute video, you need very clever compression and very fast decoding. There is a reason animated gifs are never 30 minutes long: they can't be. Without any clever compression, the file would be prohibitively large.

Animated gifs benefit from their limitations. Because they can only be short, they force their creators to be concise and not waste any of the viewer's time. Since they don't require fancy plugins or proprietary codecs, they can appear anywhere and play instantly.

There are two main uses people have found for animated gifs, given these benefits. 

## Utilitarian Animations

Ever seen this image before?

Little utilitarian animations like this are used all over the web. Animated gif is the perfect format for these: they're small and they load fast. They're so ubiquitous that people have built [cool utilities for generating them](http://www.ajaxload.info/). If you use Gmail you see might see [this one](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/images/spinner_18_18.gif) every day.

It's likely that animated gifs will soon be replaced for this purpous. Now that we have widely varying pixel densities on our screens, vector graphics are becoming more appealing for the web. Here, for example, is an SVG format spinner:

This image looks great on high-resolution displays, or when you zoom in on the page. The sad part, of course, is that SVG is only supported in [IE9 and up](http://caniuse.com/svg). So until we stop supporting IE8, animated gifs it is.

## Animated Gif Culture

They say creativity can come from constraints, and animated gifs are certainly a source of creativity. We use them to communicate: if a picture is worth a thousand words, [how many is an animation worth](http://twistedsifter.com/2012/04/50-animated-gifs-for-every-situation-ever/)? We build [communities](http://www.reddit.com/r/gif) for them. We fill [blogs](http://4gifs.tumblr.com/) with them. We've even elevated them to [an art form](http://browse.deviantart.com/digitalart/other/animation/).

Great things happen when the means of creation are freely available. Anyone can download a [gif animator](http://www.snapfiles.com/get/msgifanimator.html), or even use a [web-based one](http://picasion.com/). Video tools tend to be a little [less accessible](http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/buying-guide.html). All thanks to the simplicity of the modest animated gif.

## Survival

I really doubt that animated gifs are going away. On the web, things remain backward compatible forever.

<marquee>See what I mean?</marquee>

However, I have seen disappointing support on some devices. On my iPhone's built-in Photos app, animated gifs don't animate. However, when I text one to somebody, it magically starts animating. Is this something that will be supported someday? Or is Apple simply not interested in supporting animated gifs? Who can say.

## Conclusion

Animated gifs rule. Let's give them a little respect, and text goofy animations to our friends for giggles.
