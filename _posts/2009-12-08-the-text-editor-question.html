It was worded like this:
<blockquote>"On the back of this paper, write out every keystroke and mouseclick you would take to add five spaces at the beginning of the first 10 lines of a file in a text editor."</blockquote>
Naturally, some people protested. But he insisted that the literal meaning of the question was to be carried out.

Some students assumed it was a trick question that they didn't understand, and wrote nothing. Some students write out the entirety of what was necessary to do this in Notepad:
<blockquote>space, space, space, space, space, down, home, space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space</blockquote>
At the time, I had been learning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim</a> at the professor's advice. So, feeling very clever, I wrote this on the back of my paper:
<blockquote>:1,10s/^/     /</blockquote>
In a few days, when the exam was returned, students noticed that the this question had not been graded. The professor answered them:
<blockquote>"Your reward for getting it right is not having to write out an entire page of text to do something trivially simple. If you haven't followed my advice and learned a good text editor, you waste this much time a hundred times over every time you write a program."</blockquote>
Invaluable advice for any programmer. Use good tools, and get really good at using them.
