<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Undiscovery">Infinite Undiscovery</a> (a recent video game) has shocked me by its ineffectual use of tutorials.  Here is an event where a tutorial was used:
<ul>
	<li>A carrier pidgeon arrives.</li>
	<li>A character explains that group X communicates via carrier pigeon.</li>
	<li>You read the message.</li>
	<li>A tutorial explains that sometimes carrier pigeons will provide messages from group X.</li>
	<li>I slap my forehead.  They just explained something completely trivial after fully demonstrating it.</li>
</ul>
Meanwhile, their shop interface was too confusing for me to figure out the first couple times I used it.  No tutorial there.

It says at the bottom "Fol gold 3257, Total gold 0"

Sometimes RPGs have "followers" so I assumed it meant that.  Oh... my followers have gold, but I don't?  How do I get it from them?  When I go to what I want to buy and hit accept, it just beeps at me.  I guess because my total gold is 0.

In reality, you hit left and right to choose the amount, the total gold value goes up to show you how much you're going to spend, and the mystical "fol" refers to the amount of gold I have.  Nice.

The purpose of the interface seems to be to be able to choose all my purchases and see the total before committing.  I still don't know what "fol" is.

Moral of the story: They probably designed the tutorials earlier in development with no user feedback or usability testing.  Documentation (even integrated into the app) is not part of the functional spec: figure it out later in the process when the features have settled (they'll probably change, you know) and it is clear what needs explanation.

Update: Turns out "fol" is the currency of the game world.
