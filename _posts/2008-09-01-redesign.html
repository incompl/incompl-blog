I want to do a proper design for this site, so I've been thinking through ideas in the back of my mind.  I'm a big fan of <a title="Colour Lovers" href="http://www.colourlovers.com/">colourlovers</a> and they post a <strong>ton</strong> of photos for color inspiration.  Here are two that are driving my ideas for the redesign:

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/34165928_bc3fc63fb7_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-96" title="Red and Gray Mold" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/34165928_bc3fc63fb7_o-295x300.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="300" /></a>

Yep, mold.  But these colors are awesome.

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/kermesite.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-97" title="Red Kermesite Crystals" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/kermesite.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="240" /></a>

Red kermesite crystals.  Similar colors to above but a very different setting.

The trick will be getting a good pair of colors for the text / text background that are readable, but that work with this theme.
