I like to make DJ sets: compilations of electronic music combined into long seamless compositions. Though the individual songs are edited, warped, and layered, they are still copyrighted works by other artists, so distributing these sets is not necessarily legal. The powers that be seem to ignore the prevalent sharing of DJ sets online, but it has always bothered me that there isn't a legitimate way to share my work.
</p><p>
Enter <a href="http://mixcloud.com">Mixcloud</a>, which promises to solve this problem. Mixcloud allows users to upload and share podcasts, radio shows, and DJ sets. Impressively, <em>Mixcloud itself foots the bill for royalties</em>. They pay <strong>PRS for Music</strong> and <strong>PPL</strong> on behalf of their users.
</p><p>
In order to make this legally possible, there are a few reasonable restrictions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>audio can only be streamed, not downloaded</li>
	<li>sets must have at least  8 tracks</li>
	<li>full track lists must be provided</li>
</ul>

In addition to these limits, there was a 100 mb limit on uploads, which did limit me on my audio quality. Still, the service is free, so it's pretty impressive that this is viable.
</p><p>
The requirement to include full track lists is not just a burden. This required metadata allows for some interesting features, such as the ability to search for DJ sets that include a particular song. This is not something I've seen before and it certainly is a fun way to search for new music. Additionally, an uploader can easily mark the start times of each track in a set, and the player helpfully highlights the currently playing song.

How does Mixcloud make money from this? Two ways that I can see:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ads. The site has ugly banner ads, but hey, at least they're not kidding themselves about the need to generate revenue.</li>
	<li>Affiliates? Mixcloud puts "Buy" links in track lists, allowing you to buy individual songs from sites such as Amazon, iTunes, Beatport, and Juno. It's possible they make money from these referrals.</li>
</ul>

Founded in 2008, Mixcloud has received two grants from the <a href="http://www.innovateuk.org/">Technology Strategy Board</a>, the UKâ€™s national innovation agency. They're still running lean with only 4 employees, but if this business model is sustainable, they're really onto something here.
