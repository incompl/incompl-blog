JavaScript's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/Proto">__proto__</a> property is extremely handy but non-standard and deprecated. I've seen a lot of people around the net saying that constructor.prototype can be used as an alternative to __proto__. At first they seem to be the same:
{% highlight javascript %}function Foo() {}
var foo = new Foo();
console.log(foo.__proto__ == Foo.prototype); // true
console.log(foo.constructor.prototype == Foo.prototype); Â // true{% endhighlight %}
Unfortunately when you really start to dig in you find that they're not equivalent:
{% highlight javascript %}function Parent() {}
var parent = new Parent();
function Child() {}
Child.prototype = parent;
var child = new Child();

// child inherits directly from parent. this makes sense.
console.log(child.__proto__ === parent); // true
console.log(child.__proto__ === Parent.prototype); // false

// you might think child's constructor would be Child, but it's Parent.
console.log(child.constructor === Parent); // true

// as a result, you get this
console.log(child.constructor.prototype === parent); // false
console.log(child.constructor.prototype === Parent.prototype); // true{% endhighlight %}
<p>
This has become especially relevant lately with the introduction of __proto__'s weaker successor, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/GetPrototypeOf">getPrototypeOf</a>. It does what __proto__ does, but it's read-only, while setting the __proto__ property of an object is one of __proto's__ handy little charms.

Since not everyone supports getPrototypeOf yet, polyfills have been <a href="https://gist.github.com/1052392">popping</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/1022883">up</a> around the net that fall back to __proto__ and constructor.prototype. However, these polyfills are broken, because constructor.prototype just isn't the same thing. Adding to the confusion, <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/objectgetprototypeof/">John Resig's post</a> on getPrototypeOf insinuates that they're the same thing as well.

I'm glad that we're getting a standard way to access an object's prototype with getPrototypeOf. It's unfortunate all the polyfills I've seen aren't correct and I can't think of a way to polyfill below IE9. Anyone have any clever ideas?
