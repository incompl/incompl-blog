Wow.  I get no commitment pricing with a 2-year commitment!  And as a valued customer, I get a discounted upgrade at a higher price.

It is like no one even read this to make sure it made sense, or is just doing a terrible job trying to make me feel like their miserable offer is a favor of some kind.
