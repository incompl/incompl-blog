At [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com) I have been teaching a training called the [HTML5 Crash Course](http://training.bocoup.com). Part of that training has been a brief overview of Internet history. It's important to set context and understand why the HTML5 revolution is big, and why it's the start of something bigger.

Because I think it's such an important story to tell, I made [Internistory](http://internistory.incompl.com/), a quick set of slides that fill you in on how the web got to where it is today. [Check it out](http://internistory.incompl.com/): even if you already know this stuff, there is a picture of a sad puppy that is quite nice.
