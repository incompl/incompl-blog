Do you use your keyboard's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key">Menu key</a>? The one with a picture of a menu and a cursor. All it does is bring up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_menu">context menu</a>. It was introduced at the same time as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_key">Windows key</a> but didn't get the same press, probably because its effect couldn't compare to the indignity of having a Windows logo affixed to nigh every computer user's keyboard, their choice of OS notwithstanding.

What good is this thing in practice? For awhile I figured this would be an awesome way to correct typos while typing, since the context menu has corrections. Mistype, menu key, enter, keep typing. But alas, spell checkers notice misspellings after the word has lost focus, so the Menu key isn't really practical for this use.

So what is this thing for? Does anyone use their Menu key? Was it just another button to add to already-overcrowded keyboards along with the overwhelmingly useful ones like "open web browser" and "shut down"? Maybe that's why the delightfully simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apple-wireless-keyboard-aluminum-2007.jpg">Apple keyboards</a> don't have it?
