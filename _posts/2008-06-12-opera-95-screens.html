<a href="http://opera.com">Opera 9.5</a> is finally out.  I'm one of those weird Opera users, so this is actually exciting news for me!  I'll do a more complete rundown of the release later on, but for now here are some screens of the new darker, sleeker look 'n' feel.

Here is the landing page for the new release, in Opera 9.5.

Here is the Preferences dialog with some more of the new look 'n' feel.

Here is how the left side-bar was removed and the items are shown in their own tabs if you select them from the tools menu.
