Check out this suggestion <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> makes when I try to find a file:

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ideafind.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-171" title="IDEA Find" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/ideafind.png" alt="" width="297" height="81" /></a>

Never mind the terrible file name.  Notice how it finds it even though I didn't know it had an underscore in the name.  Making the search do exactly what you expect would have been fine, but a real programmer thinks about what is really useful, even if it defies expectations.
