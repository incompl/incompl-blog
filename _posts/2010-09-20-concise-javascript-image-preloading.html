<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/fireman-clock.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-976" title="fireman clock" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/fireman-clock-300x300.jpg" alt="A photo of a fireman fixing a large clock" width="173" height="173" /></a>

For some reason, all over the Internet people preload images like this:
{% highlight javascript %}var img = new Image();
img.src = "image.jpg";{% endhighlight %}
There is no reason for this code to be two lines. I preload my images like this:
{% highlight javascript %}new Image().src = "image.jpg";{% endhighlight %}
It would be hard to come up with a more minor nitpick than this, but if we're going to write this code hundreds of times during our lives, why not keep it simple?
