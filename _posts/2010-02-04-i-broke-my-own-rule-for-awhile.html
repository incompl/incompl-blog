I was breaking my own rule for awhile on this blog.
</p>
<blockquote>Every website should explain what it is, right off the bat.</blockquote>
<p>
I've added a new "Welcome" blurb to the right to amend this oversight.
</p><p>
It is easy to forget this rule, since this information is so obvious to the designer. But it is crucial: if a new visitor doesn't know what a site is for, and can't find out quickly, they'll often just leave.
