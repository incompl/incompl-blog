<h2>Design</h2>
<a href="http://dabuttonfactory.com/#editor"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-278" title="hunters" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/hunters.gif" alt="hunters" width="365" height="259" />A decent button maker</a>. I like looking at these.  The idea has been around forever, but they're still improving as internet technologies evolve.

An <a href="http://lovelypackage.com/shefa-young-wine/">excellent wine label</a>.  Buying wine by the label actually isn't an awful idea.   I always feel like people who care about making an excellent product also care more about making it look presentable.

I like this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jxdSfKYE1s"> music video</a>.  Sometimes creativity comes from limitations.

Can you guess how big <a href="http://www.switcheasy.com/products/ThumbTacks/ThumbTacks.php">this</a> is by its shape?  A visual metaphor can communicate something other than function yet still be effective and fun.
<h2>Art</h2>
<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/102012_1230779512_submedium.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-279" title="102012_1230779512_submedium" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/102012_1230779512_submedium.jpg" alt="102012_1230779512_submedium" width="275" height="340" /></a>Mmm, <a href="http://www.banksy.co.uk/outdoors/horizontal_1.htm">political street art</a>, featuring <a href="http://www.banksy.co.uk/outdoors/images/landscapes/nola/AbeLincoln2.jpg">Hobo Lincoln</a>.

Amazing art from <a href="http://krypt.cgsociety.org/gallery/">Yap Kun Rong at CGPortfolio</a>.
<h2>Tools and Resources</h2>
I'm thinking about using <a href="http://gravityapps.com/tags/overview/">Gravity's Tags app</a> to organize my music.  It seems like a generally useful tool.

I love data.  Here is a <a href="http://www.iplocationtools.com/sql_database.php">SQL database of IP addresses to location mappings</a>.
<h2>Whatever</h2>
I love it when someone takes something simple and does it exactly right.   Even if it is a pretty pointless product like <a href="http://failsticker.com/">Fail Stickers</a>. (yes,  I bought some)

I went through <a href="http://pets-area.com/index.php?option=com_photos&amp;view=photo&amp;id=654">every single one of these</a>.  I have no regrets.  It is here that I found the <a href="http://pets-area.com/images/users/2/3e07f376d0f3a43cbddc995ed6146ad2.jpg">best image ever</a>.

<a href="http://omegle.com/">Omegle</a> drops you in a chat with a stranger.  I have been enjoying gathering anonymous opinions about items on the Taco Bell menu.
