Everyone should watch this:

Here are the notes I took on my first watch:

The rich don't want money: they want more money. This is because passion for money is an abstract passion, not a passion as a means to do something.

The dominant fictions in the capitalist world are related to the domination of money; they are fictions of "abstract passion" aka unlimited desire.

The great challenge and responsibility for contemporary artists is to propose new fictions.

"I would propose some kind of universal friendship."

"...the amount of things that a person accumulates and never uses is enormous"

We can solve the problem of non-monetary exchanges on a large scale.

Change the passion of humanity from accumulation and competition to creation and invention
