When I threw out my last printer, I didn't realize that it would be my last. I had it in the back of my mind that I would eventually replace it. This was years ago. It has finally dawned on me that I'll never own a printer again. Printers have become obsolete for me, and I didn't even notice.

For awhile I'd have an occasional a panic: Oh crap! I need to print these concert tickets. Well, maybe I can just show them the confirmation email on my phone. Yep, it works. Anyone who requires physical tickets will mail them to you.

Oh no! I have to print tickets for my flight tomorrow. Nope. Swipe your credit card at the kiosk and your boarding passes are spat out instantly.

Every time I thought I needed a printer, I was wrong. Clearly things are only going to get more digital from here on out, so I don't think this is going to change. Â Sure, some printers must exist. The world isn't done with them yet. But I sure am.

I'll call this post my eulogy for the home printer. My first printer, affectionately known as "The Blizzard," printed out many a fine computer science homework assignment for me. Well, I could have just printed them in the lab, but still. It was fun while it lasted.
