I was taking a look at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/String/Replace">the MDC page for JavaScript's <em>replace</em> function</a> and noticed something interesting: It can take a function for its second argument.  That page is a little fuzzy on the details and other docs on the internet generally don't even mention this option.  So I explored a little.  Here is an example of using this functionality to do a search and replace.
<blockquote>
<pre>var text = "Any reviewer who expresses rage and loathing for a novel" +
           " is preposterous. He or she is like a person who has put" +
           " on full armor and attacked a hot fudge sundae." +
           " -- Kurt Vonnegut"</pre>
<pre>var count = 0</pre>
<pre>var newVersion = text.replace(/ (\w+) (is)/g, function(match, g1, g2,
                                                       position, input) {</pre>
<pre>    count++</pre>
<pre>    document.write("Match: [" + match + "]. Found [" + g1 +
                   "] before [" + g2 + "] at position [" +
                   position + "].&lt;br/&gt;")</pre>
<pre>    return " " + g1 + " " + " REALLY is"</pre>
<pre>})</pre>
<pre>document.write(count + " matches found&lt;br/&gt;")
document.write("New version:&lt;br/&gt;"
document.write(newVersion)</pre>
</blockquote>
This code will output:
<blockquote>Match: [ novel is]. Found [novel] before [is] at position [50].
Match: [ she is]. Found [she] before [is] at position [79].
2 matches found
New version:
Any reviewer who expresses rage and loathing for a novel REALLY is preposterous. He or she REALLY is like a person who has put on full armor and attacked a hot fudge sundae. -- Kurt Vonnegut</blockquote>
There is a lot going on in this example, but I think it demonstrates what you can do with this function that is definitely not possible if you only use a string for the second argument to replace.

Here are what appear to be the arguments to the function passed to replace:
<blockquote>Match: The current substring that was matched by the regex.

Group 1: The first parenthesized group in the regex.

...

Group N: The Nth parenthesized group in the regex.  There can be an arbitrary number of these.

Position:  The numeric position in the text where this match occurs.

Input: The entire input text with changes that have ocurred so far.</blockquote>
The power to customize your replacement based on a variety of factors, as well as have an unrelated behavior happen for each match, is definitely useful.  Another JavaScript secret revealed!
