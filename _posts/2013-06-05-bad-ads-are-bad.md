Check out this [Microsoft Research paper on the cost of annoying ads](http://www.dangoldstein.com/papers/goldstein_mcafee_suri_annoying_ads.pdf). Here are some quotes from the conclusion:

> The main result of this paper is that annoying ads lead to site abandonment and thus fewer impressions than good ads or no ads. In what might be seen as good news for publishers, good ads and no ads led to roughly equal numbers of impressions. Annoying ads impaired people's ability to carry out an email classification task, suggesting that annoying ads have a real cost to users beyond mere annoyance.

> Nevertheless, we expect that our finding that annoying ads cost the user at
least $1 CPM over more pleasant ads will be obtained in some other environments.

(CPM is [cost per impression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_impression))

> This work also suggests a variety of policy recommendations. Most directly, the $1 CPM user cost... is a reason that publishers should insist on a substantial premium for annoying advertisements.

Great data, though my policy recommendation is [a little stronger](http://webadvertisingisbroken.com/).
