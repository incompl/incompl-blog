<h2><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/avlxyz/313854298/"><img class="alignright" title="Delicious Oysters" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/101/313854298_98f9c02ba1.jpg" alt="Some delicious oysters" width="267" height="201" /></a></h2>
<h2>Fun / Interesting</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2248998/">It's OK for vegans to eat oysters</a>. I really respect this pragmatic approach to ethics. Plus, oysters are damned delicious.
</p><p>
<a href="http://mrdoob.com/projects/harmony/">Harmony</a> drawing tool. Great way to spend a few minutes when you need to get the creative juices flowing.
</p><p>
Vodka is often disregarded as "neutral" or "flavorless" but I've found that vodkas vary more than I once thought. This is <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/all-we-can-eat/spirits/how-would-you-describe-vodka.html">one of the few treatises I've found on the subject</a>.
</p>
<h2>Art</h2>
<p>
A neat street art series by "<a href="http://www.thisisludo.com/">Ludo</a>" called <a href="http://twistedsifter.com/2009/12/natures-revenge-ludo/">Nature's Revenge</a>.
</p><p>
<a href="http://theimpossiblecool.tumblr.com/post/500782628/cocker">The Impossible Cool</a>. Simple, classic, black-and-white photos of famous actors, authors, and so on.
</p><p>
<a href="http://gorillaartfare.com/">Gorilla Artfare</a> is a great art blog, backed by a very creative (closed-doored) community.
</p><p>
<a href="http://interfacelift.com/wallpaper_beta/downloads/rating/widescreen/2560x1600/">InterfaceLIFT</a> lets you view wallpapers for a given screen resolution. I really wish other sites where I get wallpaper, such as <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">Deviantart</a>, would do this.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.notcot.org/">Notcot</a> is an interesting art / design blog. Their thumbnail-centric format is something that would sound like an awful idea if you described to me, but they pull it off.
</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/iphone/app/"><img class="alignright" title="RTM" src="http://1.static.rememberthemilk.com/img/services/ss_iphoneapp.png" alt="A screen shot of the Remember the Milk iPhone app" width="200" height="116" /></a>
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a>. A comprehensive to-do list organizational tool. It's $25/year, but their iPhone app is really nice. I appreciate touches like being able to choose what the app badge represents (total due items, or items due today).
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.marco.org/380868888">Feature checklists suck</a>. Glad someone took the time to properly bash them so I don't have to.
</p><p>
I always have trouble finding good starting point themes for blog designs. I think I'll try out <a href="http://themeshaper.com/thematic/">Thematic</a> for my next Wordpress project.
</p><p>
A presentation about <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664">Netflix's corporate policies and culture</a>. As surprising as it is inspiring. For example, they did away with vacation day policies, and just let people just take days off at will.
