In one of my favorite RPGs, [Arcanum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcanum:_Of_Steamworks_and_Magick_Obscura), there is a race called [half-ogres](http://www.terra-arcanum.com/sierra/world/world-races_ogrehybrids.html). That race description, taken from the manual, has some interesting (if lurid) conjecture about the origin of the race. In the Arcanum setting, half-ogres are a bit of a mystery. How could they exist? Why are they mostly male? Why are they fond of gnomes, halflings, and children?

There is a quest in Arcanum where you can learn the answer to this mystery. In the quest, the player travels to an island where he or she discovers that there is a gnome conspiracy to kidnap victims to breed half-ogre bodyguards for themselves. The player finds a journal with proof:

![](/images/arcanum/arcanum%20plot%201.jpg)

Here, most players expect they can give the journal to the proper authorities, expose the conspiracy, and bring justice to the world. That's not what happens.

The player can give the journal to a journalist named Sam Longwell, who promises to run the story and expose the conspiracy.

Later, it is revealed that Sam Longwell was a fake.

The real journalist, from whom the player learns Sam Longwell was a fake, doesn't believe the story. Worse, the player already gave away the journal, so there is no proof.

And that's it. You can't expose the conspiracy. The half-ogre mystery remains a mystery, and only you, the player, know the truth.

The fan response to this quest was extremely negative. Most people found it confusing, supposing that it was incomplete. Sadly, much of Arcanum is incomplete, so this is very plausible.

Here is one person supposing that the quest is in fact complete:

Here, on the other hand, is a thread of people discussing if the quest is complete or not, and discussing modding the game to add additional outcomes:

My favorite observation in the thread:

> The mere fact that every few months or so people are creating threads about this specific quest is testament to how awesome it is.

It certainly did get people talking. I was happy with the quest how it was. It's ok for the player to lose sometimes. Some things are just bigger than the player. The player isn't omnipotent. Or at least, in Arcanum they aren't.

Still, it's easy to understand why so many players were frustrated by this quest. In most RPGs, every problem that is presented to you is there for you to solve. Few RPGs ever say "There are trolls from the nearby cave attacking villagers!" just for flavor. They would certainly never say that without presenting you with a convenient nearby cave, trolls about your level, and well-balanced experience and gold reward for your efforts.

Few RPGs take place in a dystopian fantasy world without giving you the opportunity to spend 80 hours getting to level 50 so you can defeat the evil god-king and bring peace to the galaxy. Players have come to expect that their enjoyment in a game should come from conquering, manipulating, and owning the game world. It exists just for them, after all.

So players were deeply dissatisfied by this Arcanum quest. It took away their omnipotence.

I propose that the expectation that every problem can be solved limits games to a certain type of world, and a certain type of story. A world in which the player is at the center, and a story where the player always saves the day.

Imagine a story about a street urchin in a major city. They dream of the greater world outside the city walls, and they dream of climbing the social ladder; that's part of the character. But the game is about surviving and avoiding starvation. That kind of character and that kind of story is just as important as stories about heroes saving the world. In fact, protagonists can be more relatable and human if they're not larger-than-life. Novels tell all kinds of stories, and so should games. Game designers should take a page from the Arcanum playbook: they should let the world be bigger than the player, and they should allow outcomes that aren't ideal, at least sometimes. Some players will complain, or preferably adjust. But ultimately players will appreciate it when they play games that tell a wider variety of stories.
