### So we meet again

I recently replayed Final Fantasy VII and [wrote a review](http://blog.incompl.com/2014/01/05/ffvii.html). Afterwards I decided to revisit the next game in the series. My memory of Final Fantasy VIII was that it was terrible. However, my expecations couldn't have been higher at the time. It was the follow-up to one of the most memorable console RPGs of all time. I decided to revisit FFVIII with a new perspective: was it really so bad, or did it just have a tough act to follow?

Final Fantasy VIII is highly produced. Where FFVII is inconsistent and rough around the edges, FFVIII appears to have polish and attention to detail throughout. At first this seems to be an improvement, but it's only skin deep. Even on an aesthetic level the consistency makes it feel bland. What you have is a beautiful shell around a game that is boring at best and broken at worst.

### Let's fight

Most of my complaints about FFVIII were directed at the combat. At first it seems fine, but quickly some quirks appear. Some common enemies have extremely high HP and take awhile to kill. The game's "Draw" system, where you absorb spells and can only cast as many as you've stocked, seems odd, but not disturbingly so. At least not yet. As you go, you learn that you can equip stocked spells to your stats. The more you've stocked the more the stat bonus. You rarely cast your spells between this and the fact that the spells just aren't too effective. Stocking the latest spells becomes a chore, and it's never clear how useful it is to begin with.

As the game goes on these sorts of problems become worse. The "junction" system, the game's name for equipping spells to different stats, is needlessly complex. It needs to be constantly maintained but it affords no opportunity to develop interesting strategies. Sure, you can equip a bunch of Fire spells to your sword when fighting Ice monsters, but the advantage is usually so minor that it feels like a waste of time.

You might forgive the problems listed so far, but soon it gets much worse. As enemies' HP gets higher, spells and normal attacks become all but useless. Your Guardian Forces, or summons, do huge damage, so are an effective way to win your fights. In fact, they're too effective: you can summon your GFs over and over without penalty. Soon the most effective strategy is to repeat the same summons and watch the same fancy animations play out in lieu of actual gameplay. It's important to point out that the enemies are not difficult: they just have a lot of HP. You rarely feel like you're in any danger. You're just searching for the quickest way to get the battle over with. What was wrong with the expensive, limited summons of FFVII?

As you go your characters learn increasingly powerful Limit Break abilities. It's nice that there is another way to effectively fight your enemies, and it's nice that they have mercifully short animation times. Sadly, the Limit Break system is just as broken as the Guardian Force system. Limit Breaks only trigger when your HP is low. An effective strategy is to just leave your HP low all the time so you get more Limit Breaks. The enemies don't hit for enough damage for this strategy to put you at risk. Why didn't they just leave Limit Breaks the way they were in FFVII?

The final straw is a blatent bug in the Limit Break system. The chance of getting a Limit Break is random, but higher if your HP is low, or if you have the vital Aura spell. However, if you hit the button to switch to another character, the system "rerolls" your chance to get a Limit Break. You can just keep hitting "switch character" until you get a Limit Break. This works even if only one character is available and you're not actually switching between them. This finalizes the fact that Limit Breaks are the new Guardian Forces: another improperly balanced mechanic that lets you spam the same powerful moves over and over to defeat the non-dangerous but furiously sturdy enemies.

### The world

While I was playing FFVIII I wanted to be able to enjoy it despite the combat system. There were beautiful environments and nifty effects like seamless transitions to full-motion video. In the first few towns I had to stop and stare at each new vista. Eventually I felt like they all looked too similar, but I could overlook that in the absense of deeper problems.

### The cast

Squall, the protagonist, benefits from being more flawed than the previous game's protagonist. Probably the highest compliment I can give FFVIII is that Squall's character development was well-paced and compelling. His romance with Rinoa is an emphasis of the game: the happy couple is hugging in the game's logo, after all. Sadly Rinoa is not as convincing as Squall and doesn't seem to have as much development.

Clearly the game is about Squall and Rinoa. The rest of the cast is problematic. Every single one feels like one of the genre's quirky bonus characters that you wouldn't actually want to use. Zell is the face-tattooed loudmouth that literally has more dialog in all caps than not. Selphie is the braindead eye candy who magically gets away with being psychotically reckless. Quistis is one of Squall's teachers who is somehow 18 and who uses (what else but) a whip in combat. Irvine is a cowboy who pretends to be a badass and a lady's man but is actually a coward. This last character concept sounds good on paper but in practice you just hate him for his borderline harassment.

The game has a variety of flashbacks where the the party all falls unconcious and dreams about the exploits of a fellow named Laguna and his pals. Laguna seems like a decent character that you might grow to care about, but his flashbacks are not connected to the main plot. Indeed, upon waking up from their repeated group hallucinations the party's response is "let's not worry about this right now" and even "who cares." Well, to answer your question, not me.

### The story

The story seems odd yet intriguing at first but soon devolves into simply bad. The main problem is that it feels like the game was partially rewritten to accomodate major plot changes. There are some plot twists that make no sense and don't fit into the larger story. Many plot elements aren't supported by the flow of the game and seem disconnected. If I had to guess I'd say the game was too boring as originally written and the attempts to spice it up didn't help.

### SeeD rank

My favorite gameplay mechanic in FFVIII is something called your SeeD rank. SeeD is the mercenary outfit the protagonists are part of. Your rank determines your pay which you are rewarded with periodically and informed of via on-screen message. Your actions determine your rank in a variety of ways. The system successfully creates little conflicts between being a good soldier and doing as you please. This works extra well because you don't know which decisions effect your rank, but every time you see your rank go down it makes you wonder if you need to take your job a bit more seriously. A couple times the game shows you a mission report that outlines your performance, but these seem to go by the wayside as the plot starts to meander off in another direction.

### Conclusion

I barely got into disc 2 of this 4-disc game before my patience was gone. My foray ended after a dungeon that involved a lot of identical rooms and backtracking. I was very optimistic that I might enjoy this game if I went into it with more reasonable expecations, but no. The game's merits are wholly overshadowed by the utterly broken combat and scatterbrained plot.  FFVIII was a painful reality check. I had hoped that FFVII had ushered in a new golden era where RPGs were as beautiful as they were fun. FFVIII demonstrated that the transition to high-budget 3d games ran the risk of leaving behind the heart of what makes games fun.
