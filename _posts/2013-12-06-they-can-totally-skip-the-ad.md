[This article by Andy Beaumont](https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/a30bbe8b54a5), the creator of [Tab Closed; Didn't Read](http://tabcloseddidntread.com/), makes a very good point regarding modal ads that cover the page when you visit a site:

> What we’re witnessing here is the first wave of the second world pop-up war... The web has seemingly evolved into something that actively antagonises people — why would anyone in their right mind hide the content that visitors are there to see?
>
> In short, maybe they’re not in their right mind. This is what happens when analytics make decisions for you.

He's saying that analytics can lead you to make web design choices that are effective but with harmful side-effects. You can gain conversions by confusing and frusterating your users. Specifically, users will watch an ad or fill out a form if they mistakenly believe they don't have a choice. Even if you give users a choice, *your analytics may encourage you to obfuscate this choice*. Put another way, analytics will teach you to be cold, calculating, and selfish. Perhaps even [evil](http://webadvertisingisbroken.com/).

In recent months I have been really upset about the state of ads on Youtube. Now I have realized why: besides being annoying, the Youtube ads are probably effective because they are cold, calculating, and selfish. Let's look at this example:

<img src="/images/evil-youtube.png">

No one really wants to watch a 2 minute ad before their video. 99% of the time the user will want to just skip it. So why does Youtube have super long ads that you can easily skip?

My guess is that the analytics say that the ads are effective. And the reason the ads are effective is probably because the ads confuse people. "How can they be confused? The skip button is right there!" you might ask. The reality of the situation is that Youtube users are trained to ignore little boxes on their video. They are usually themselves ads or useless annotations created by the person who uploaded the video. If users have been trained to ignore little boxes like that, they may watch the it without realizing they're watching an ad or realizing that they can skip it.

Also, I guess Youtube puts ads on their ads now, but that's neither here nor there...

Look. Web users are distracted and busy. They don't read every word of copy on every page. The worst part is that non-technical people suffer the most from this type of technique. Technical people who make websites too-often forget just how non-technical their audience can be.

What's the solution? As Andy Beaumont points out, one solution is [usability testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing). Analytics are useful, but they're only one piece of the puzzle. If your analytics are leading you down the path of evil, your usability testing can help catch it.

Also, it can't hurt to just use your head a little bit more. Come on Google, your search ads are the high watermark of unobtrusive and useful! Throwing user experience away to make a quick buck is only effective in the short-term. Or maybe Youtube is such an expense that they don't mind driving their users a little nuts?
