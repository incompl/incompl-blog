I've been using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a> for all my code and markup editing needs. It has an awesome plugin system, but while there are lot of plugins, the quality varies. Lots of people keep a list of their favorite packages, and this is a great way to learn about the ones that people use and like.

To that end, I made my own list of Sublime packages! <a href="http://static.incompl.com/sublime/">Take a look</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/session?text=%40_gsmith">let me know</a> if I'm missing your favorite!
