I created this cocktail thanks to [The Flavor Bible](http://www.amazon.com/The-Flavor-Bible-Creativity-Imaginative/dp/0316118400/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1358726018&sr=8-2&keywords=the+flavor+bible). This book contains an extensive reference of ingredients with flavors that pair well with each. Some of the combinations are predictable; some are not.

The pairing that got me thinking was Star Anise and Maple Syrup. So I wanted to make a cocktail that combined them. Ginger was my third addition: Maple and Ginger are an obvious pairing, and Indian cuisine has tought me about combining Anise and Ginger.

After trying a few base spirits, I ended up using bourbon. I was worried it'd be too sweet, because this is similar to an Old Fashioned or a Sazerac and I hate it when those are too sweet. The absinthe seems to make it work. Try this out if you want a sweeter and more wintry Old Fashioned variation with a unique flavor trifecta.

### The Cold Fashioned

* 2 oz. Bourbon (I used [Bulleit](http://www.bulleitbourbon.com/gateway.aspx))
* 1 spoonfull Maple Syrup
* 1 spoonfull Ginger Syrup ([I swear by this stuff](http://www.gingerpeople.com/organic-syrup.html))
* 2 drops absinthe (a little goes a long way; I suggest an eyedropper or straw)
* dash Angastora bitters

Stir with ice and serve with one ice cube.
