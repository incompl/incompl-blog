I recently gave a talk at [eCoast Responsive Design Summit](http://ecoastsummit.com) in Portsmouth, NH. It was a great day of practical discussion from many perspectives, and since it was at the [Redhook brewery](http://redhook.com), it was also a day of delicious beer.

[Here are the slides from my talk](http://static.incompl.com/ecoast/).
