I've been following the evolution of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) for many years, and it's always fun to watch the trends that come and go since they ebb and flow so quickly. It's still a young style of music, and I'm always craving something new.

In this post I'm going to talk about an up-and-coming subgenre: Complextro. I'll keep it light and just focus on examples of cool music.

[Electro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electro_%28music%29) is one of the oldest styles of EDM, and it's interesting that you can still trace its lineage back to its funky, robotic, vocoded origins in 1980s Detroit. More recently it has been well-blended with House and combined and altered in many ways, often approaching the world of pop.

In 2012, [Porter Robinson](http://soundcloud.com/porter-robinson) [coined the term Complextro to describe his sound](https://twitter.com/PorterRobinson/statuses/100706347779235840) with the portmanteau of complex and electro. [BT](http://soundcloud.com/bt) figured that the term would stick as the name of the style at large, and he was right.

What aspects of Robinson's sound were wrapped up into the term Complextro? Most generally, Complextro brings interesting and complex melodies and basslines to the more straightforward world of electro house. More specific is the video game influence, which for Robinson [originates from his childhood love of Dance Dance Revolution](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304299704577502452164796814.html). Other features associated with Complextro are [chiptune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune) sounds (another video game influence), [glitchiness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_%28music%29), and use of instruments or influences not typically found in electro house.

Robinson's 2011 hit *Spitfire* is probably the most prominent example of what Complextro has come to mean:

Some might argue that this is [dubstep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstep), due to use of halftime beats in much of the track. But they aren't throughout, and what doesn't have some dubstep influence these days? If all else fails, use the umbrella term [Bass Music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_music) for anything that blurs these lines.

Althrough Robinson coined the term, he isn't the first to make music of this style. In [Wolfgang Gartner](http://soundcloud.com/wolfganggartner)'s 2009 track *Firepower*, you can hear the complextro sound with more chiptune and less dubstep:

My personal favorite artist making Complextro is [Savant](http://soundcloud.com/aleksander-vinter). His varied musical background, [as a composer of metal, orchestral, hip-hop, and electronic music](http://dj.beatport.com/drakedans), gives him the range to really put the complex in complextro. His 2012 anthem *Starscream Forever* is one of my favorite tracks of the year:
