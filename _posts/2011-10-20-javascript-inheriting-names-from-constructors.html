Over the course of a project I'm working on I've run into a few really weird JavaScript behaviors. This is one of them. It only happens with theÂ <em>name</em> property, probably because of how names are handled for constructor functions.
{% highlight javascript %}function Foo() {}

// This should be Object.prototype, or {}, or omitted completely,
// but certainly not the Object constructor. Still, what follows
// isn't exactly what you'd expect...
Foo.prototype = Object;

var foo = new Foo();

function Bar() {}

Bar.prototype = foo;

var bar = new Bar();

bar.name = 'hello';

bar.name // 'hello' in chrome, 'Object' in firefox{% endhighlight %}
