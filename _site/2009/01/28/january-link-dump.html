<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-243" title="Silhouettes Screen Shot" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/screen-capture.png" alt="screen-capture" width="293" height="240" />Here is a <a href="http://allsilhouettes.com/">stock site just for silhouettes</a>.  Quality, free, focused stock sites are hard to find.

<a href="http://www.cyd.liu.se/~tompe573/hp/project_sfxr.html">SFXR</a> is small app for quickly making old-school video game sound effects.  The joy here is that they have predefined parameters for types of effects, such as "jump", and you can choose a randomly generated sound within those parameters, then randomly mutate or manually tweak it.  Much faster than creating sounds from scratch.

When dealing with 256 pixels, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art">pixel-art</a> becomes a much more useful skill.  Hence this <a href="http://www.favicon.cc/">nifty tool for creating favicons</a>.

You may have seen <a href="http://labs.ideeinc.com/multicolr/">Flickr's tool for searching by color</a>.  It is amazingly fun, but the real reason to toss it in the toolbox is because so many of Flickr's images are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_commons">Creative Commons</a> licensed nowadays, oftentimes making them valid as stock or blog dressing.
<h2>Art</h2>
<a href="http://conceptships.blogspot.com/2009/01/simon-scales-concept-ships.html"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-244" title="Concept Ships Screenshot" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/screen-capture1-300x266.png" alt="Concept Ships Screenshot" width="300" height="266" />Concept Ships</a> is a blog dedicated solely to concept art of space ships.  I love this stuff.

Along those lines, here is <a href="http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=141787">a site with lots more concept art</a>.  It's easy to get lost wandering around this site.  They really need an RSS feed with featured artists though, or something along those lines at least.
<h2>Random</h2>
