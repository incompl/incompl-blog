          Decided to spruce up the design of this blog.  I wanted texture, and here it is!

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/screen-capture.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-402" title="Incompl Redesign" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/screen-capture-300x217.png" alt="Incompl Redesign" width="300" height="217" /></a>

Decided to not use any PNG transparency hacks and just let the browser do what it wants with what I throw at it.  As a result, the few visitors that are using IE6 will get less-than-ideal rendering.  I may add a "This page won't look right in IE6" message later.

The background could use some compression optimization as right now it looks a little crappy.  Drop me a line if you have any great suggestions for tools to optimize this kind of image (I have an uncompressed version to work with).
