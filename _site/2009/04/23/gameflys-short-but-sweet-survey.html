      <h2>GameFly's Short but Sweet Survey</h2>

          I have never filled out a product survey.  Until today.  Let's look at why this one is so good:

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/gameflysurvey.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-318" title="Gamefly Survey" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/gameflysurvey.png" alt="Gamefly Survey" width="488" height="346" /></a>

This survey is:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Short</strong>.  From just a glance I can tell I am 1 click away from finishing the survey.  The start of a survey of unknown length that scrolls off the page is far less inviting.</li>
	<li><strong>Relevant to my life</strong>.  How quickly games appear in the mail is something I actually care about.</li>
	<li><strong>Showing interest</strong>.  It says "Hey, did you get that game we sent you?" rather than a less personal "Rate our service on a scale of 1 to 10."</li>
</ul>
In addition to my being pleased with it, I'm sure <a href="http://www.gamefly.com/">GameFly</a> gets useful data from these.
