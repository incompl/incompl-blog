          Here is a new <a href="http://brewsandsuch.com">personal project</a> of mine.

<a href="http://brewsandsuch.com"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-523" title="Brews and Such" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/brews-and-such.png" alt="Brews and Such" width="536" height="369" /></a>

It is still in the works, but I've been posting to it as I work on it. It uses a couple interesting WordPress plugins to do the detailed classification: specifically, the fields and tag clouds for flavors, breweries, and beer styles.

The design is not mine, but my policy is to get the site running before spending a lot of time on that part. It'll be a great site to do a design for when I want some new portfolio material.
