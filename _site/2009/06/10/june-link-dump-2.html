<a href="http://repper.studioludens.com/">This pattern creator</a> is neat, but I'm curious about their use of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>. Can (or should) you really apply a Creative Commons license to the output of this kind of tool? To me it seems akin to if Adobe said that they have a license for anything you create with Photoshop.

For a long time, e-commerce sites were prohibitively annoying to set up. <a href="http://blog.weebly.com/2/post/2009/05/announcing-weebly-e-commerce-features.html">Weebly's new features</a> are one of the reasons that this is no longer the case.

Speaking of CMSs, I like the idea of hosted CMSs designed for a particular type of site. <a href="http://www.enjin.com/">Enjin</a> is a gaming CMS that understands what their audience wants and focuses on doing that really well.

<a href="http://www.shapeways.com/">3D items made to your specification</a>? I'm pretty sure everyone has wanted this service to exist at one point or another.

I admit to being a fan of interactive fiction. And <a href="http://www.infocom-if.org/downloads/downloads.html">Zork</a> is free now, so hooray!

I enjoy  <a href="http://imgur.com/LU8pX.jpg">careful timing in re-purposed comics</a> and <a href="http://www.polkaswithpugs.com/s9/uploads/greathamster.jpg">blob rodents</a>.
