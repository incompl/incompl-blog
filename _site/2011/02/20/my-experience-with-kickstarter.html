I recently raised $743 in donations to my side-project, a web-based game titled <a href="http://startcontinue.com">91</a>. I used the fund-raising site <a href="http://kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> and the experience was delightful and fascinating. Here is how it happened.
</p><p>
I’ve been working on 91 for about a year. The first post on the game’s blog was on 11/27/2009 but I had been working on the game before that, though I’m not sure when coding actually began. Many of the ideas present in the game have been brewing in my head for several years.
</p><p>
I had been looking at Kickstarter just out of curiosity. It’s an interesting site: users create projects that they want to get funded by donations. These projects are usually creative and include art, theater, music, writing, and of course games. Each project has a deadline and a funding goal, usually measured in thousands of dollars. Each project is funded only if the goal is met. If the goal is not met, no money changes hands. The idea here is that if a project requires the full amount in order to become reality, then no one should have to donate to a project that doesn’t meet its goal and cannot be completed.
</p><p>
An additional feature is that projects are required to have rewards. If a project is successfully funded, donors may receive a reward based on how much they donated. This adds an additional incentive and personal touch to each project. Project creators can choose whatever rewards they’d like.
</p><p>
It seems to me that Kickstarter has several functions. One, they handle all the money, which is nice. Second, they’re a trusted name, so having a Kickstarter project gives you a certain authenticity that makes people less skeptical about donating. Further, they’re offering their promotion and their marketing smarts. It’s not arbitrary that Kickstarter requires deadlines and rewards. These are known to be successful ways to raise money, and Kickstarter wants you to succeed. Kickstarter offers great advice throughout the process, and they also drive a fair amount of traffic to your project, especially if you’re featured on their home page. In exchange, Kickstarter takes 5% of what you raise.
</p><p>
So, I decided to raise some money. There is one little inconsistency here: isn’t Kickstarter for potential projects that need money to begin? My game isn't complete, but it's already underway. Well, my idea passed Kickstater’s approval process, so they seem to be flexible. My goal was to cover costs I’ve incurred while developing the game, which are not completely negligible. This money isn't for personal use, excluding of course pizza deliveries during late-night coding sessions. My costs for my first year developing 91 look like this:
</p><p>
<ul>
	<li>LunarPages Hosting (12 months) $107</li>
	<li>LunarPages Domain Registration (1 year) $20</li>
	<li>Github (12 months) $84</li>
	<li>Coda (software) $99</li>
	<li>iShowU HD (software) $30</li>
	<li>12 silly sunglasses (Kickstarter reward) $13</li>
	<li>20 custom postcards from <a href="http://moo.com">moo.com</a> (Kickstarter reward) $20</li>
	<li>VectorDesigner (software to create postcard graphics) $30</li>
	<li>12 custom booklets from <a href="http://lulu.com">lulu.com</a> (Kickstarter reward) $64</li>
	<li>Concept art commission (Kickstarter promotion) $60</li>
</ul>
Total: $527
</p><p>
This works out to be very close to what I chose as my project goal, $500. I decided to see if I could raise this much money in 30 days, from 1/8/2011 to 2/7/2011.
</p><p>
The question of what to offer as rewards was an interesting one. I looked at other successful projects for ideas. The sunglasses were the idea of a friend of mine. Here are the rewards I used. Each reward includes all the rewards from the lower tiers.
</p><p>
<strong>$10 or more: Get your name / url posted on http://startcontinue.com/community/thanks</strong>
</p><p>
The idea here was to try to get people to donate at least $10. There were still 5 people who donated less than $10 and didn’t get any reward.
</p>
<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/rewards.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1059" title="rewards" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/rewards-300x226.jpg" alt="A photo of the rewards I sent out to Kickstarter supporters" width="300" height="226" /></a>
<p>
<strong>$25 or more: A booklet with a short story about the game and a postcard with a map of the city the game takes place in.</strong>
</p><p>
This seemed to be the reward people were most interested in. I believe that in general Kickstarter backers want creative and personalized rewards related to the project they’re donating to.
</p><p>
<strong>$50 or more: In addition, get sweet neon sunglasses, and your character in-game starts with sweet sunglasses.</strong>
</p><p>
Either because the reward was lame or because $50 is not a compelling donation quantity, only one person donated at this level.
</p><p>
<strong>$100 or more: In addition, you get an NPC named after you in the game, and your name/link goes in the startcontinue.com footer.</strong>
</p><p>
To my surprise and delight, four people donated at this level. It’s hard to say if the rewards were a factor, because these are some awesome and generous people either way.
</p><p>
<strong>$500 or more: I’ll fly to wherever you are and buy you a beer in person. Limit 1, first come first serve.</strong>
</p><p>
This wasn’t my idea, there actually was another project that offered this reward. It was a sort of a joke to begin with, honestly. No one donated at this level.
</p><p>
Another thing Kickstarter suggests is making a video to explain your project. Your video is featured right at the top of your project page. I thought about taking a lot of time to make a high-quality video, but I didn’t want to waste the effort if I was only going to get $30 of pledges. I made a quick video demonstrating the game, figuring that I could always make a better one later, which I never did. Besides, the game can speak for itself. People know a game they want to play if they see it, right?
</p><p>
With that all determined I started the project, totally unsure of if anyone would be interested in donating. I wouldn’t have been surprised if the project received no attention and ended with mere pocket-change in pledges.
</p><p>
Donations trickled in for the first week. I posted the project on social media sites such as <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> and <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a> and some forums such as <a href="http://roguetemple.com/forums/">Roguetemple</a>. This generated enough interest to raise my first $100. During this time it looked like the I may or may not make my goal, depending on if I could keep up the pace.
</p><p>
During the second week, the project stagnated. I had posted to all the forums and sites I thought were relevant, and didn’t want to get spammy. I considered making a new, better video to promote the game, and probably would have if this kept up. I also commissioned some concept art to help promote the game and make the project more eye-catching.
</p><p>
After January 18th something interesting happened. People started to notice 91. There was some discussion about the game on <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">rockpapershotgun.com</a>’s forums around this time, which drove more interest and traffic than I expected. Also, a couple more predominant members of the gaming community started to donate generously and help promote the game. It seems that the best way to get attention is to get mentioned in the right forums or social news sites, and to get noticed by the right people. With new people helping to promote, 91 was mentioned in new places and new avenues of traffic opened up. Not just that, it was the right kind of traffic, as these people were donating at higher levels.
</p><p>
Thanks to this, I suddenly met my goal in a matter of days. It was a really exciting time! This is where I stopped worrying about promotion and started working on the rewards I’d need to send out.
</p>
<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/91-on-kickstarter-home-page.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1053" title="91 on kickstarter home page" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/91-on-kickstarter-home-page.png" alt="Screen shot of 91 on the kickstarter.com home page" width="262" height="238" /></a>
<p>
On January 28th another interesting thing happened. 91 was featured on the kickstarter.com home page. This drove a great amount of traffic. During this time I got around 250 referrals to startcontinue.com from Kickstarter, which is only a subset of the number of people who visited the Kickstarter project page. Since these are people who clicked-through from the project page, these were 250 people who had looked at the project page and wanted to learn more.
</p><p>
91 was featured on Kickstarter’s home page again a few days later, driving another 150 referrals to startcontinue.com.
</p><p>
On February 1st 91 was featured in an article on <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/">pcgamer.com</a> titled “10 games you can help fund now.” The article was later taken down; I’m not sure why. I do have a backup of it. The article was very sarcastic, probably in response to some of the projects that were featured, some of which were asking for a lot of money with little to show for themselves. One commenter went so far as to suggest that all of these projects were scams. Well, maybe some of them were, if they weren’t simply misled or overly-ambitious. At least I felt vindicated by this: the author starts describing 91 by saying “You’ve got to have a soft spot for roguelikes, and developers who aren’t deluded, greedy bastards.” They give a quick overview of the game and seem generally positive. However, they switch back to sarcasm, and conjecture that my reward of flying out to buy a beer for the $500 donor was an attempt to get a free holiday. The article ends: “Greedy bastard!” I have the feeling that this was all in good fun, but I admit I was a little confused at the time, especially given the more earnest disdain being doled out nearby. It’s not clear to me if this exposure led to any contributions.
</p><p>
On February 7th the funding period closed. The project was a great success, reaching 149% of its goal (yes, you keep whatever you raise above the goal) with $743 total. I was quite pleased, but actually felt a bit pressured too. Suddenly my little side-project had actual expectations attached to it for the first time.
</p><p>
Once the funding period closed I started organizing my rewards. Kickstarter lets you send out surveys to automatically collect the information needed from backers, such as their shipping addresses. The sunglasses I ordered on Amazon: that was easy.  I ordered the custom postcards from moo.com, which prints them in multiples of 20, so I have some extras. I ordered the booklets from lulu.com and they turned out beautiful. I had everything shipped to my apartment so I could combine them, add some personal touches, and ship a single packet to each backer. One thing I didn’t think about was international shipping costs, but only a couple of backers were international so it was manageable.
</p><p>
One lesson I learned is that I’m not much of a marketer. 91 is a unique game and it’s hard to tell exactly who would be interested in it, but I missed the mark, and never thought to post in some of the forums that ended up being very interested in the game. Also, since certain people ended up being extremely helpful in promoting the game, if I did this again I’d send emails (or maybe tweets?) to influential members of the gaming community right off the bat, telling them about the game and asking not for donations but for help promoting the project. Of course, I’d send personal emails only to people I thought would be genuinely interested in the game based on what I knew about them. I don’t think any less personal emails or mass-marketing is likely to work and could even harm goodwill.
</p><p>
Another thing I learned is that having a working demo was crucial to my success. Many people are skeptical of Kickstarter projects that promise the world but don’t have convincing credentials suggesting that the project will be a success. I didn’t have to prove much to anyone: people who wanted to know what I was capable of could just play the work-in-progress and see it for themselves.
</p><p>
Another interesting fact is that some people thought I was being greedy. My Kickstarter page mentioned that I do this in my spare time and that I do have a day job, so some people said they saw no reason to donate to me since I didn’t need the money. That’s true, I’m not a starving artist trying to put food on the table. And certainly, those types of people should get money before I should. But still, I think anyone who creates art, be it video games or novels or paintings, is putting their heart and soul into their work, not to mention their time and money. There is nothing wrong with people who enjoy such art giving something back. Would these people think any differently if I charged for the game instead of asking for donations? Would it be different if I was making a different type of game than a roguelike, most of which are free? It’s hard to say.
</p><p>
Overall this was a great experience. At this point I’m not developing 91 at a personal financial loss. Much better, though, is all the people I’ve met and talked to throughout the process. I’ve gotten a lot of great feedback on the game and it’s really encouraging seeing that people are interested in my work. My plan now is to keep at it. The game came a long way in its first year. I’m hoping that in another year it’ll be done. We’ll see how it goes! If you want to learn more about 91, visit <a href="http://startcontinue.com">http://startcontinue.com</a>.
