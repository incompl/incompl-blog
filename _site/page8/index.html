    <a href="http://opera.com">Opera 9.5</a> is finally out.  I'm one of those weird Opera users, so this is actually exciting news for me!  I'll do a more complete rundown of the release later on, but for now here are some screens of the new darker, sleeker look 'n' feel.

Here is the landing page for the new release, in Opera 9.5.

</a>
Here is the Preferences dialog with some more of the new look 'n' feel.

Here is how the left side-bar was removed and the items are shown in their own tabs if you select them from the tools menu.

I have no doubt that they are documented out there somewhere, but I'm not much for reading manuals, I confess.
<h2>Double-press the menu button</h2>
This does one of two things, depending on the context.

<em>iPhone locked:</em> This will bring up iPod controls.  The touch screen will now let you pause, play, skip, etc.

<em>iPhone unlocked, music playing:</em> Same as above

<em>iPhone unlocked, no music playing:</em> Takes you to the "Favorites" list to make a call.
<h2><strong>Horizontal swipe</strong></h2>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
In some lists, such as your inbox, swiping from right to left or left to right over an item this will bring up the option to delete the item you swiped over.  Barely faster than other methods, but I have started using it when convenient.
<h2>Maps zoom vs. Safari zoom</h2>
You probably already know that in the browser you can double-tap to zoom in on a section of the page, then do it again to zoom out.  In the Maps application, things work a little differently.  Here you can double-tap (tap twice in a row quickly) to zoom in, but to zoom out you tap with both fingers at once (can't call this double-tapping too, do we have a more terse lingo for the two-finger-tap yet?)

    Being a web developer (and <a title="TechCrunch" href="http://techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a> reader) I end up trying a whole lot of web apps.  Some of them are very cool, but few are so cool that I actually end up using them.

Recently <a title="Wakoopa" href="http://wakoopa.com">Wakoopa</a> managed to sneak into my "cool enough to keep" list.  Aside from sounding like a Super Mario Bros. enemy, and having a stylish white, gray, black, neon green, and neon pink theme, Wakoopa is basically <a title="Last.fm" href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> for desktop apps.  You install a service (Mac or PC) that reports which of your applications receive the most of your attention.  Here is what I have been using for the last few days:

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/wakoopa_pie.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11" title="wakoopa_pie" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/wakoopa_pie-300x174.png" alt="" width="300" height="174" /></a>

I guess it isn't very interesting that I mostly just use my web browser (<a title="Opera" href="http://opera.com">Opera</a> is great, by the way), which makes you immediately wonder if this should be a way of tracking which web sites you visit.  But the usefulness isn't in seeing your own habits.

The first interesting use is in discovering new applications.  Just perusing the categorized and tagged lists of apps, ordered by popularity, is a great way to discover tools and time-wasters alike.

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/wakoopa_tags.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12" title="wakoopa_tags" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/wakoopa_tags-297x300.png" alt="" width="297" height="300" /></a>

This screen shot shows a few things.  First, that the first couple results aren't very interesting.  Second, that they are not 100% accurate (unless there are some masochists doing their text-editing in Photoshop out there).  but third, we see some very popular applications that aren't so well known.  I haven't heard of a couple of these, but immediately I feel the need to go figure out what makes them so popular.  That is really the core of the Wakoopa product.

Aside from discovery, Wakoopa has another interesting use.  A friend of mine recently bought a Macbook and asked me what all the fun apps for it are.  I named a few (<a title="Adium" href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a>, <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>, <a href="http://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a>), then realized that I could link them to my Wakoopa profile to show them what I actually used.  They found this pretty helpful.  In short, Wakoopa seems like an efficient way to share with friends what applications you find useful, and I'm sure I'd be interested in seeing the same about people I know.

I recommend giving this site a try.  I don't have any Wakoopa contacts yet, so if you do, feel free to add <a title="My profile on Wakoopa" href="http://wakoopa.com/gsmith">me</a>.

  <h2 class="title"><a href="/2008/05/27/object-identity-crisis.html">Object identity crisis</a></h2> 
<div class="post post-/2008/05/27/object-identity-crisis">
  <div class="entrybody">
    One of the things I learned a few years ago is that a lot of people who program in object-oriented languages don't have a good answer to these questions:  What is an object?  What is an object-oriented language?

It is easy to explain, but the very clear and precise answer is another thing.

An object is something that has identity, state, and behavior.  Most "things" in a programming language, besides objects, only have one or two of these traits.  Depending on the language, and oversimplifying a little, we see this:

Value: Just identity
Variable: Just state
Function: Just behavior
Struct: Identity and state
Subroutine: State and behavior
Functor: Identity and behavior
Object: All of the above

This reveals one of the elegancies of objects: they can represent any other type of "thing" in a programming language.

As for the other question: What is an object-oriented language?  Saying it is a language with objects is technically wrong.  You can have objects in languages that aren't generally called object-oriented.  What about languages where objects are first class?  Hmm, nah, how well a language treats its values seems to be independent from the type of language it is.

The answer I like is that an object-oriented language has some way of abstracting over objects.  This is a vague requirement, but thankfully the types of object-oriented languages, such as class-based or prototype-based, happily declare their way of abstracting over objects right in the name.

I probably didn't teach anybody anything here, but I sure like straight-forward answers to straight-forward questions.

  <h2 class="title"><a href="/2008/05/22/xhtml-lists.html">XHTML Lists</a></h2> 
<div class="post post-/2008/05/22/xhtml-lists">
  <div class="entrybody">
    This one caught me off guard.  I was converting a document to XHTML strict and had a list and sub-list that looked like this:
<pre>&lt;ul&gt;</pre>
<pre>    &lt;li&gt; Thing 1 &lt;/li&gt;</pre>
<pre>    &lt;ul&gt;</pre>
<pre>        &lt;li&gt; Subthing 1 &lt;/li&gt;</pre>
<pre>        &lt;li&gt; Subthing 2 &lt;/li&gt;</pre>
<pre>    &lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
<pre>    &lt;li&gt; Thing 2 &lt;/li&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
Understandably, XHTML isn't keen on a child of a <em>ul </em>being something other than a <em>li</em>.   So the logical fix is this:
<pre>&lt;ul&gt;</pre>
<pre>    &lt;li&gt; Thing 1 &lt;/li&gt;</pre>
<pre>    &lt;li&gt;</pre>
<pre>        &lt;ul&gt;</pre>
<pre>            &lt;li&gt; Subthing 1 &lt;/li&gt;</pre>
<pre>            &lt;li&gt; Subthing 2 &lt;/li&gt;</pre>
<pre>        &lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
<pre>    &lt;/li&gt;</pre>
<pre>    &lt;li&gt; Thing 2 &lt;/li&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
This creates a mysterious problem.  Your list ends up looking like this:

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/weirdlisthtml.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5" title="Weird List" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/weirdlisthtml.png" alt="A strange-looking list" width="145" height="97" /></a>

Yep, a little odd.  This happens, it turns out, because XHTML expects the sub-list <em>li</em> to contain some text, just like any <em>li</em>.  This becomes the <em>li</em> that corresponds to the sub-list you are creating, which normally is just the <em>li </em>before the sub-list you are making.  So, our fixed markup looks like this:
<pre>&lt;ul&gt;</pre>
<pre>    &lt;li&gt; Thing 1</pre>
<pre>        &lt;ul&gt;</pre>
<pre>            &lt;li&gt; Subthing 1 &lt;/li&gt;</pre>
<pre>            &lt;li&gt; Subthing 2 &lt;/li&gt;</pre>
<pre>        &lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
<pre>    &lt;/li&gt;</pre>
<pre>    &lt;li&gt; Thing 2 &lt;/li&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
Now we have a list that looks like what we expected:

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/normallist.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6" title="Normal list" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/normallist.png" alt="A normal looking list" width="145" height="102" /></a>

Ultimately, this feels like a problem with XHTML to me.  The broken behavior we saw seems like it should be outright invalid XHTML, but it is not, according to my validator at least.  In the meantime, if you fall into this trap, hopefully you'll remember what to do.
