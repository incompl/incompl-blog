    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Undiscovery">Infinite Undiscovery</a> (a recent video game) has shocked me by its ineffectual use of tutorials.  Here is an event where a tutorial was used:
<ul>
	<li>A carrier pidgeon arrives.</li>
	<li>A character explains that group X communicates via carrier pigeon.</li>
	<li>You read the message.</li>
	<li>A tutorial explains that sometimes carrier pigeons will provide messages from group X.</li>
	<li>I slap my forehead.  They just explained something completely trivial after fully demonstrating it.</li>
</ul>
Meanwhile, their shop interface was too confusing for me to figure out the first couple times I used it.  No tutorial there.

It says at the bottom "Fol gold 3257, Total gold 0"

Sometimes RPGs have "followers" so I assumed it meant that.  Oh... my followers have gold, but I don't?  How do I get it from them?  When I go to what I want to buy and hit accept, it just beeps at me.  I guess because my total gold is 0.

In reality, you hit left and right to choose the amount, the total gold value goes up to show you how much you're going to spend, and the mystical "fol" refers to the amount of gold I have.  Nice.

The purpose of the interface seems to be to be able to choose all my purchases and see the total before committing.  I still don't know what "fol" is.

Moral of the story: They probably designed the tutorials earlier in development with no user feedback or usability testing.  Documentation (even integrated into the app) is not part of the functional spec: figure it out later in the process when the features have settled (they'll probably change, you know) and it is clear what needs explanation.

Update: Turns out "fol" is the currency of the game world.

  <h2 class="title"><a href="/2008/09/04/javascript-as-the-webs-systems-language.html">JavaScript as The Web's Systems Language</a></h2> 
<div class="post post-/2008/09/04/javascript-as-the-webs-systems-language">
  <div class="entrybody">
    We all know there are system programmers and higher-level application programmers.  At the extreme ends of each category: a dude writing C to work on the Linux kernal, and a dude writing Java to create a text editor.  These two fellows deal with very different tasks.  Generally, the former can write stuff that runs faster, and the latter can write stuff more easily.

I'm starting to think that the web is going to get a similar disjunction.   JavaScript may become the C of the web.  I'm not referring to how some new JavaScript engines are approaching the speed of C (not there yet, but certainly getting there).  I'm talking about how JavaScript is becoming the systems language of the web platform.  You write JavaScript to create either really fast webapps, or use libraries implemented in JavaScript to more easily write slower webapps.

Look at some jQuery code for a second:
<pre>$("#dog").show()</pre>
<pre>.addClass("barking")</pre>
<pre>.load("dogdata.html")</pre>
It starts to look more like a domain-specific language for DOM manipulation than actual JavaScript.

Since that may be a stretch for some people, here is a better example, further into the disjunction I'm talking about.  <a href="http://cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino</a>.

What are we looking at here?  A library that is much more powerful than typical web app libraries.  It uses its own programming language (Objective-J).  And if the demos are to be trusted, the resulting software is much slower than stuff written in plain JavaScript.

Imagine years down the line if we had web app developers that knew Objective-J, but not JavaScript.  Us JavaScript guys would be useful for maintaining these libraries, and for doing the jobs that need to be blazing fast.  Sound like a C developer of the desktop world?

Obviously this trend could be derailed depending on how browsers develop.  I found it an interesting pattern nonetheless.

    I want to do a proper design for this site, so I've been thinking through ideas in the back of my mind.  I'm a big fan of <a title="Colour Lovers" href="http://www.colourlovers.com/">colourlovers</a> and they post a <strong>ton</strong> of photos for color inspiration.  Here are two that are driving my ideas for the redesign:

Red kermesite crystals.  Similar colors to above but a very different setting.

The trick will be getting a good pair of colors for the text / text background that are readable, but that work with this theme.

  <h2 class="title"><a href="/2008/08/27/rpg-box-art-my-top-3.html">RPG Box Art: My Top 3</a></h2> 
<div class="post post-/2008/08/27/rpg-box-art-my-top-3">
  <div class="entrybody">
    Here are my top 3 favorite pieces of box art for console RPGs.
<h3>3: Final Fantasy IV DS (North America)</h3>
<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/ff4ds_ntsc_front.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85" title="Final Fantasy IV DS Cover (North American)" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/ff4ds_ntsc_front.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="445" /></a>

A newcomer.  Why?

The art style of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshitaka_Amano">Yoshitaka Amano</a>.  This piece demonstrates one of his signatures: some areas have high complexity, some areas are fairly plain.  I'm not actually sure if he designed this logo, but it is clearly in his style.

Perfect positioning.  A temptation might have been to ignore the ESRB and Square Enix text.  But in this case it was carefully considered.

Black.  Final Fantasy box art is usually light colored or white.  They decided to make this release stand out by making it as sinister as it is sleek.

Great use of foil.  You can't tell in the picture, but the logo is metallic.  Too many games make poor use of foil in their box art.  Some of them simply make the whole box semi-metallic, only succeeding in making it hard to read.  If you own this game or see the box in the store, take a moment to appreciate how the use of foil is sharp and clean, but matte enough to avoid being distracting.
<h3>2: Breath of Fire III</h3>
<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/cover-front.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86" title="Breath of Fire III Cover" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/cover-front.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a>

Also dark and simple.  Why?

Realistic fire.  This will really stand out in a rack of games sporting CGI renders.

Use of symmetry.  This is well balanced, but the fact that the vertically-centered line (the sword and the i) are only subtly indicating the center of the image is what takes the cake.

The i.  They ignored the temptation to go bad-ass all the way.  The candle is subtle, thoughtful, and well-executed.  Notice the yellow glow around the candle flame.  That wouldn't work except against the black of the sword.

This box art falls short though.  The "The Classic Role Playing Game" text is white on light orange on the left side.  This is sloppy.  My guess is that this got tacked on after the real designer's job was done.
<h3>1: Final Fantasy VII (Japan)</h3>
<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/ff7_jap.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-87" title="Final Fantasy VII Box Art" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/ff7_jap.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="423" /></a>

Lots of white.  Why?

In Japan, the title could sell this game, given the circumstances.  The designer knew this and decided that this was more than any flashy artwork could do.

The font.  This is the first Final Fantasy cover to use this logo style, to my knowledge, and it has been used ever since.  A brilliant example of how to make a fantasy font look distinguished.

Off-center. The logo isn't presenting itself as the center of attention, neither in size, nor in position.  It is simply there.

The logo background image.  In this version it isn't clear that this is a meteor, so it gains meaning as you play.  A fantastic symbol for the game (on several levels) with a stylish fade.

    <p style="text-align: left">Here is a great way to make your political party look awesome:</p>

Sure, it is an interesting approximation of the American political landscape.  But as a piece of propaganda it is brilliant.  It says "Not only are we the exact opposite of those Bad guys (populist is often replaced by totalitarian or authoritarian) but also we are even further away from them than those other guys."

As a crazy hippie and professed Libertarian I can't help but love it.

  <h2 class="title"><a href="/2008/08/19/explorability.html">Explorability</a></h2> 
<div class="post post-/2008/08/19/explorability">
  <div class="entrybody">
    I've started considering <strong>explorability</strong> a metric of code quality.  Exploribility is how easily a programmer can follow code paths within the program when reading the source code.  Things that adversely effect explorability are often adversely impacting some other quality of the code.  On the other hand, many are perfectly acceptable when used correctly.

Here are some examples:

Side-effects (the reader may have difficulty making the leap from effect to cause, among the other problems with side-effects)

Using string values to control program flow (IDEs can't easily track them, for example enumerations are better in some cases)

Reflection / "eval"-type functions (Again, your IDE probably can't track this type of thing)

Line wrapping at bad times (Reduces effectiveness of IDE search functions, for example it can be bad to wrap in the middle of a file path)

Unnecessary String parsing (<em>foo = foo.replace("fresh", "funk")</em> when<em> foo = "icon_funk.gif"</em> is better, again effects usefulness of IDE search functions)

Sometimes explorability comes into conflict with other best-practices (in the previous example, the code may need to abstract away the file extension).  But it is definitely a good ideal to reach towards.

  <h2 class="title"><a href="/2008/08/05/programming-sub-skills.html">Programming Sub-Skills</a></h2> 
<div class="post post-/2008/08/05/programming-sub-skills">
  <div class="entrybody">
    Programming is definitely a skill, but its sub-skills are a little fuzzier.  It is often broken down by language.  You have programmers who are good at Java, or C, or Smalltalk, or Self, or JavaScript, or whatever.  This is useful to know, but it is not the whole picture.

To me, this is like breaking down "people who are good at cars" as people who are good at Mitsubishis, or Fords, or Hondas, or Lamborghinis, or Caterpillars.  In reality, you also need to know who is good at racing, construction, manual transmission, driving in snow, and so on.  Someone who drives Mitsubishis might know how to fix their cup holders, so it is good to know who is good with that make of vehicle, but again, that isn't the whole picture.

This can cause trouble.  Your average software developer resume doesn't tell you if the person is good at pointer arithmetic, or higher-order functions, or prototypal OOP, and so on.  You often have to infer it from the language list, and honestly that process is not as fail-proof as it seems.  Many people who know JavaScript don't even know what prototypal OOP is.  I'm not sure how many people who know C are pointer arithmetic wizards.  You can make an educated guess, but I hate guessing, and I'd do a bad job guessing the specific skills of someone whose primary language is C++, as C++ just involves so much stuff.  I love resumes that go deeper, and appreciate the ones I've seen.

We also don't hear much about the groupings of these sub-skills.  We all know that a fellow who implements operating systems in C and a fellow who develops blog software in Ruby have very, very different skill sets.  But we don't talk about system skills and implementation skills as much as we talk about system languages and implementation languages.

It is harder to write a resume that says "I am good with higher-order functions and closures" rather one that simply says "I am good with Lisp" and leaves the rest implicit.  But that is the direction I think we should move in.  Far too often I have no idea what kind of programmer is behind a resume until the interview, which can lead to a lot of wasted time.  I'd way rather hear that real programmers can think in pointers than hear that real programmers use C.  And in general, I'd like to have an easier time communicating with people about types of programmers and their various skills.
