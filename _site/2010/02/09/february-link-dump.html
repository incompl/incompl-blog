The <a href="http://portfolio.tigaer-design.com/port_flash.html">portfolio of Christian Hecker</a> has sci-fi concept hardware and environments.
</p><p>
As does the <a href="http://koshime.cgsociety.org/gallery/477931/">portfolio of Dr. CM Wong</a>.
</p><p>
I've been listening to <a href="http://www.friskyradio.com/">Frisky Radio</a> at work a lot. It's electronic dance music with an emphasis on progressive house and tech house.
</p><p>
I like these <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/11/mind-blowing-hyperrealistic-sculptures/">hyperrealistic sculptures</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperrealism_(painting)">hyperrealism movement</a> as a whole is fascinating to me.

<p>
<a href="http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Acorn</a> is a great Mac image editor, with free and $50 versions. I feel like I'm late to the game on this one, but I only recently gave up on the frustrating Mac ports of <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>.
</p><p>
Turn your Macbook's track pad into a pen tablet with <a href="http://tenonedesign.com/inklet.php">Inklet</a>.
</p><p>
<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2009/11/02/why-do-we-have-an-img-element">The origin of the HTML img tag</a>, as proposed in 1993.
</p><p>
I always have at least one <a href="http://www.noupe.com/fonts/45-outstanding-free-vintage-fonts.html">free font site</a> bookmarked for these link dumps.
</p>
<h2>Programming</h2>
<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/love-docs.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-691" title="LOVE docs" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/love-docs-300x257.png" alt="An excerpt from the LOVE documentation" width="300" height="257" /></a>
<p>
I haven't used <a href="http://love2d.org/docs/">LÃ–VE</a>, a framework for making 2d  games in Lua, but their simple and well-documented API makes it sound  really appealing.
</p><p>
Speaking of game development frameworks, <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/">Unity</a> recently released a free version of their very comprehensive and mature  3d game development platform.
</p><p>
<a href="http://nodejs.org/">Nodejs</a> lets you write a web server in JavaScript with event-based IO. I have a  few projects in mind that might be good guinea pigs for this framework.
</p><p>
A <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/11/liberal_regex_for_matching_urls">liberal regex for matching URLs</a>. The URL syntax is too complex for most half-assed patterns to be sufficient.
</p><p>
Checking if a JavaScript object is an Array is actually not simple. Here is <a href="http://perfectionkills.com/instanceof-considered-harmful-or-how-to-write-a-robust-isarray/">an analysis and useful solution</a>.
</p><p>
Here is some <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hiring">advice on hiring programmers</a>. I've felt since the beginning of my career that the typical interview process is deeply flawed, but am only recently getting an idea of what I'd rather do instead.
</p>
<h2>Useful</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://geoipweather.com/">My preferred weather site</a>. Can the cluttered and unhelpful <a href="http://weather.com">weather.com</a> just give up their domain name to them?
</p><p>
There is a lot of software to record audio playing on your computer. So far I think <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> works the best for me.
</p><p>
If you have anything on your computer that should be encrypted, but isn't, set up <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a> right away.
</p>
<h2>Fun</h2>
<p>
<img class="alignleft" title="VVVVVV" src="http://thelettervsixtim.es/images/pic1.png" alt="Screen shot of the VVVVVV game." width="304" height="141" />
</p><p>
The oddly-named <a href="http://thelettervsixtim.es/">VVVVVV</a> is a nice  puzzle/platform game that reminds me of other independent concept  platformers like <a href="http://www.braid-game.com/">Braid</a>.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.captainforever.com/captainforever.php">Captain Forever</a> is a simple but engaging game that lets you salvage parts and upgrade your ship in real time as you play against bigger and more complex adversaries.

A <a href="http://samizdat.cc/cyoa/">comprehensive analysis</a> of the choose-your-own-adventure style of interactive fiction, along with novels you can read along with a visualization of your progress through the decision tree.
</p><p>
