Robert Biswas-Diener wrote <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/worklife/02/16/o.procrastinator.or.incubator/index.html?hpt=Mid">an article on CNN</a> coining the term "incubator" for people who seem like procrastinators but are actually a different breed. I felt that this article described my own work habits perfectly.
</p><p>
Incubators have a clear sense of deadlines, gets things done on time, and produce quality work. Before performing an important task, such as writing a term paper, they engage in an incubation phase that is necessary for their process. It looks like slacking off, but their mind is constantly brewing, preparing information for the outpouring of effort to come.

I always knew that I work this way, and that other people are like me. What I like about this article, though, is that Robert decided to give a name to it. From the article:
</p>
<blockquote>For most incubators, having a label that is less pejorative than "procrastinator" can be a breath of fresh air.</blockquote>
