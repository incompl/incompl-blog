The man purse. The <em>murse</em>. This oft-reviled accessory should, judging by its function, enjoy ubiquity among the possession-conveying public. Incomprehensibly, it is a taboo of sorts. Well, it's 2010. This year, nothing is sacred. Not even society's most enduring conventions.
</p><p>
What defines a man purse, anyway? One would think that it would be a purse worn by a man, but oftentimes the stately messenger bag, when perceived to be sufficiently emasculating in style or stature, is considered a man purse as well. This broader category may be the intent of the term "man bag" but I will use the terms interchangeably here. We're all in this together.
</p><p>
To be entirely clear, here is a picture of myself with my second-favorite manpurse.
</p><p>

A Man
</p><p>
Look at this stately man. Note the splendor. Why, surely nothing is amiss here.
</p><p>
Yet still the eyes of many see the above as analogous to what follows:

</p><p>
Slightly Misleading
</p><p>
That's right. Small bags are forÂ <em>ladies</em>.
</p><p>
Forget it. The sexes are equal now. Men can wear little bags, and women can wear cowboy hats.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Social Progress
</p><p>
Let's say you appreciate that attire does not define your sexuality. Kudos! But you're still not convinced of the man purse's practicality. Let me show you what I have in my bag today.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Items
</p><p>
Glasses, sunglasses, headphones, book, pen. Sometimes there will be a hat and gloves, outgoing mail, and other such sundries. This is the very image of convenience and efficiency. A backpack, briefcase, or messenger bag would be excessive. The additional bulk would be an uncomfortable addition. On the other hand, simply stuffing the pockets of a coat would be insufficient and, I dare say, unsightly.
</p><p>
Further, there are altruistic reasons to sport the man purse. On a public subway, for example, space is at a premium. As you stuff your body and possessions into a crowded train, behind you there may be a <em>human being</em> whose truancy could have resulted from your selfish use of a bulky bag.

</p><p>
Not a human being
</p><p>
I trust this convinces any but the most bigoted of naysayers. And to those who need no converting: Right on. But still, while it might feel like the world is your oyster, every time you take a swig of water from the bottle in your bag you must remember those who sacrificed their dignity to earn you that privilege. They are mankind's greatest heroes.
