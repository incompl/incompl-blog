<p>
Have you ever been to a restaurant by yourself? Taco Bell doesn't count. Somebody asked you "How many people in your party?" and you said "One."
</p><p>
Let's say I'm walking home from work and I want a hot tasty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_sandwich">Reuben</a>. I can go to the grocery store, buy the ingredients, assemble the sandwich, heat up the griddle, and make it myself. But why should I? There are probably at least 10 places I walk past on my way home from work that serve this sandwich. I've decided to have dinner out.
</p><p>
But alas, I'm alone. I could call a few friends and see who is up for dinner, but I'm too hungry to wait, and quite frankly, maybe I just want to stare into space and daydream while I eat. I do it all day at work, why mess with success?
</p>
Given that I'm on my own, there are only a few types of places where I can go.
<h2>Go casual</h2>
If an eatery is sufficiently casual then eating alone there may not be a <em>faux pas</em>. How much the casual venue affects your ability to enjoy the meal depends on what you're after. My bases are covered if I want a deli sandwich or a Double Quarter Pounder with cheese. If I want rare filet mignon with seared asparagus and Gorgonzola mashed potatoes, this option won't help me.
<h2>At the bar</h2>
Due to the stigma surrounding drinking alone, you have to be careful here. It's hard to explain exactly when this is acceptable. There are some bars that just feel more comfortable for eating by yourself. The staff may or may not be amenable to your behavior. If the bar is empty, you just look depressing. If the bar is full, you're getting in the way when people are trying to order another round of Michelob Ultras. Sometimes when I intend to eat by myself I'll walk past a few bars to try to find one where I feel like I'd be comfortable.
<h2>Takeout</h2>
I've found that you can get takeout from pretty much anywhere. Delivery is a major service for a venue to offer, but pick-up doesn't inconvenience most venues in any way, so they seem happy to oblige. Though readily accessible, this option has more downs than ups. Your food may be cold by the time you get around to eating it, you won't get to enjoy the restaurant's ambiance, and it's difficult to time the pickup.
<p>
OK, so there are options. But why the rigmarole? Why is it socially unacceptable to go to dinner by yourself? I guess I can see a few possibilities...
</p>
<h2>The Venues</h2>
Maybe guests by their lonesome just aren't lucrative enough. A duo can split an appetizer and a bottle of wine, but a single guest is generally limited to a single drink and entrée. Then again, are solo eaters really discouraged by the venues proper? I haven't tried to go to a fancy restaurant by myself. What would happen?
<h2>Personal Appearance</h2>
Maybe people are just self-conscious about being alone. Restaurants are a place for people to go and enjoy themselves. What is better than enjoying a nice hot meal and a few drinks with some friends? Why <em>wouldn't</em> you bring a few buddies? That person at the table alone, playing Scrabble against the computer on their iPhone, what's their problem? No friends? Are they so obnoxious/ridden with body odor that they... <em>have no friends</em>?
<p>
In any case, let's fix this. Go to a restaurant by yourself. Order the <em>duckling à l'orange</em> and a stiff martini and treat yourself right. If we all do it, it's no longer socially unacceptable. So, folks: get on it.
