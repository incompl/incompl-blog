<div class="post post-/2008/12/25/javascript-the-replace-secret">
  <div class="entrybody">
    I was taking a look at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/String/Replace">the MDC page for JavaScript's <em>replace</em> function</a> and noticed something interesting: It can take a function for its second argument.  That page is a little fuzzy on the details and other docs on the internet generally don't even mention this option.  So I explored a little.  Here is an example of using this functionality to do a search and replace.
<blockquote>
<pre>var text = "Any reviewer who expresses rage and loathing for a novel" +
           " is preposterous. He or she is like a person who has put" +
           " on full armor and attacked a hot fudge sundae." +
           " -- Kurt Vonnegut"</pre>
<pre>var count = 0</pre>
<pre>var newVersion = text.replace(/ (\w+) (is)/g, function(match, g1, g2,
                                                       position, input) {</pre>
<pre>    count++</pre>
<pre>    document.write("Match: [" + match + "]. Found [" + g1 +
                   "] before [" + g2 + "] at position [" +
                   position + "].&lt;br/&gt;")</pre>
<pre>    return " " + g1 + " " + " REALLY is"</pre>
<pre>})</pre>
<pre>document.write(count + " matches found&lt;br/&gt;")
document.write("New version:&lt;br/&gt;"
document.write(newVersion)</pre>
</blockquote>
This code will output:
<blockquote>Match: [ novel is]. Found [novel] before [is] at position [50].
Match: [ she is]. Found [she] before [is] at position [79].
2 matches found
New version:
Any reviewer who expresses rage and loathing for a novel REALLY is preposterous. He or she REALLY is like a person who has put on full armor and attacked a hot fudge sundae. -- Kurt Vonnegut</blockquote>
There is a lot going on in this example, but I think it demonstrates what you can do with this function that is definitely not possible if you only use a string for the second argument to replace.

Here are what appear to be the arguments to the function passed to replace:
<blockquote>Match: The current substring that was matched by the regex.

Group 1: The first parenthesized group in the regex.

...

Group N: The Nth parenthesized group in the regex.  There can be an arbitrary number of these.

Position:  The numeric position in the text where this match occurs.

Input: The entire input text with changes that have ocurred so far.</blockquote>
The power to customize your replacement based on a variety of factors, as well as have an unrelated behavior happen for each match, is definitely useful.  Another JavaScript secret revealed!

I found the information actually pretty unhelpful as an actual Boston resident.  So, for my fellow Bostonfolk, here are some additional notes to make the list a bit more useful.

1 ) Harbor Cruise: Skip if it isn't a booze cruise.

2 ) Museum of Science: Only if you're nine years old.

3 ) Walk through Beacon Hill: Walking up hills sucks, just go have dinner on Charles St.

4 ) Show at the Wang: Only if it is a concert, and bring 10s for the bar.

5 ) Walk down Newbury: And buy clothes and eat dinner. Repeat once or twice a month.

6 ) Cappuccino in a North End Cafe: Or get pissed that there is no parking and do something else.

8 ) Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum: If your family is visiting.

9 ) Skywalk Observatory: If someone from outside the country is visiting.

10 ) See the Skyline from a Bridge: If you don't already see it twice a day while commuting.

Designers love to excuse things like this by saying "Dude that's dumb, everyone can tell it is music coming out of the headphones."  In reality it doesn't matter if the user can discern the intent.  It still looks like your logo beefed.

    Check out this suggestion <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> makes when I try to find a file:

Never mind the terrible file name.  Notice how it finds it even though I didn't know it had an underscore in the name.  Making the search do exactly what you expect would have been fine, but a real programmer thinks about what is really useful, even if it defies expectations.

  <div class="entrybody">
    The most important programming skill I can think of has nothing to do with programming.  It is the ability to think of every task in the context of the software that is being made.

The task: write an HTML parser in one week.  A good programmer gets it done.  A great one explains why the project is better off using an existing HTML parser.

The task: write a function to export a data structure to XML in three days.  A good programmer gets it done.  A great programmer asks why, finds out the reason for the task is irrelevant, and spends three days doing something useful.

The task: write a class that encapsulates some inventory business logic in a day.  A good programmer gets it done.  A great programmer thinks about it, nods, then gets it done.

If you're worried that if you followed this process you'd often get the response "Just do it!" then your management may have some serious problems.

It seems awfully simplistic for a framework, but it is serving the same purpose.  How far can we go, using a predefined set of CSS classes instead of picking our own when we design?  I'm not sure yet if a whole site could be reasonably made this way, and I'm not sure anyone has tried.  But it is an interesting question: stylesheets are already reusable on a small scale (element selectors rather than class and id selectors) and it is fun to wonder if we can make them even more generally useful.
