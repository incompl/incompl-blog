    A commenter on my <a href="http://incompl.com/2008/the-problem-with-patterns/">Problem with Patterns</a> post had an interesting response:
<blockquote>"It think that what you are trying to do, identify patterns that are more interesting because they are not so much a work-around for missing language features is an interesting approach—and greatly more sophisticated that the average “critique” of patterns. And yet, would Flyweight seem so interesting in a language with symbols and automatic memoisation?"</blockquote>
I'll go ahead and plug <a href="http://peripateticaxiom.blogspot.com/">their blog</a> as thanks for being so insightful.

This got me thinking about what I was really getting at.  The whole thing came to mind after having a "I hate design patterns" conversation with someone, but really we were trying to say "I hate having to use a design pattern to do something that should be easy."  Usually this happens when you are aware of a different programming language in which doing that thing would be easy.  Or maybe you're just very imaginative.

So what I decided to get out of the whole discussion (both with commenters and with other people I've spoken with lately) is that some programming languages are <strong>Pattern Prone</strong>. A Pattern Prone language is a language where certain restrictions or missing features cause you to repeat complex processes to solve simple problems.  This is a fuzzy measurement: you can't really make a definitive list of what languages are Pattern Prone.  But it <em>will </em>give you a better way of expressing certain complaints without posting on your blog that there is a Problem with Patterns.

    I've been noticing websites using patterned backgrounds again.  This is a trend that died pretty early, but the resurrection has been tasteful thus far.  <a href="http://www.inviteshare.com/">InviteShare</a> is one site that pushes on the idea hard, takes risks, and pulls it off.  I love the black translucent parts contrasted with the orange translucent parts.  Also, intricate, flowery patterns look great in dark gray on black.  My favorite dress shirt is dark gray on black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paisley_(design)">paisley</a>.

To experiment with the technique, I've put a pink skull pattern on this site.  It could use some tweaks, but I'm going to let it sink in for a bit before I decide what to do with it.

    Changing text size in a web browser is an accessibility feature. I've never seen someone do this besides to read text that is too small. Anyone with sub-par vision needs your site to be accessible. Hell, I do, if I forget my glasses somewhere.

I want to bring it up because major browsers are changing the way they zoom. Opera seems to have started it, and now Firefox 3 does it as well: Modern browsers scale the content wholesale, rather than shifting around font sizes and letting the layout recalculate with the new values.

This is great! Any complex layout requires careful thought to get zooming right: You're basically designing 3 or more different layouts (the big one, the normal one, the small one). Layout becomes slave to font sizes rather than pixels, the actual medium you're working in. With the way new web browsers are being made, soon you'll never do any work to make your site scale. Keep that in mind, watch the progress browsers are making, be ready to stop designing for old-school zooming as soon as it makes sense for you to stop.

(Note: I later wrote <a href="http://incompl.com/2008/pattern-prone/">this post</a>, which comes to a better conclusion than this article did -Greg)

I'm not a big fan of design patterns.  I know, I know, what could be bad about established processes for solving equally established problems?

I'm not going to complain about misuse of design patterns.  I can roll my eyes at overuse of Singletons, but can't say overuse is the pattern's fault.  A lot of people misuse the Factory Method Pattern.  Sometimes people seem to just use this pattern for the hell of it, when a normal constructor would suffice.  Still, these people are Doing It Wrong, so it is their own fault.  I'm not even going to complain that people use patterns as an excuse to not really think through their problems and figure out the best thing to do.  Like I said: This is not what is wrong with design patterns.  This is what is wrong with bad programmers.

So what is wrong with design patterns?  Let's start by analyzing a few examples.  I'm going to draw my examples from the ubiquitous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0201633612/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1214921430&amp;sr=8-1">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a>.

Lets look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern">Command Pattern</a>.  In it "A command object encapsulates an action and its parameters."  I always call this the Functor Pattern, because I call these things Functors.

In a lot of languages, this doesn't even constitute a design pattern.  The idea of functions as first-class objects, specifically functions that can be assigned to values, makes doing this a fundamental part of programming in that language.  For that reason, we can adjust the definition of the pattern:

"A command object encapsulates an action and its parameters.  This is useful in languages that don't allow function values."

Here is what is interesting: The pattern is not about programming.  It is about programming in this particular language.  In some other languages, the pattern is meaningless.

Let's look at another example.   The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern">Factory Method Pattern</a> is about hiding the concrete class of an object.  Look at this constructor (in Java):
<pre>class DatabaseConnection {</pre>
<pre>    public DatabaseConnection() {</pre>
<pre>        ... do some set up work ...</pre>
<pre>    }</pre>
<pre>}</pre>
Lets say we want to implement both MySqlDatabaseConnection and SqlServerDatabaseConnection.  But we want which one we use to be defined in a configuration file rather than in the code.  Normally you would create a constructor for each of these classes, but then, when you want to instantiate the database connection, you have to pick one.  You can't do this:
<pre>class DatabaseConnection {</pre>
<pre>    public DatabaseConnection() {</pre>
<pre>        if (Config.getConfig().getDatabaseType().equals(DatabaseType.MYSQL)) {</pre>
<pre>            return new MySqlDatabaseConnection();</pre>
<pre>        }</pre>
<pre>        ... else if etc ...</pre>
<pre>    }</pre>
<pre>}</pre>
Doh!  Constructors have no return values, so this is just bogus, though it might seem like what you want to do.  The Factory pattern is the way to do this that actually works.

But stop.  See what happened there?  We are using a design pattern because we can't do what we want to do.  If Java constructors worked a little differently, and let us construct an object of an arbitrary subtype of the type the constructor lives in, there would be no Factory pattern.

As you begin to analyze the various established Design Patterns, you start to notice this type of thing more and more.  A lot of them solve problems that are imposed by the programming language you are using.  Some ways to recognize such patterns are:
<ul>
	<li>The pattern is too trivial to mention in a different programming language</li>
	<li>The pattern results from being unable to do what seems naturally correct</li>
</ul>
Not all design patterns are like this.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern">Flyweight Pattern</a>, for example, seems to basically reduce to optimizing the time-space trade-off of a group of many similar hashes.  This is more of a data structures thing than most Design Patterns seem to be.  It is also particularly interesting and useful, in my opinion.

So, going to sum up and draw some conclusions.  It is no accident that Java is the language that brought Design Patterns to the forefront of our minds: It also is a language that loves to force you to do things in very particular ways, especially as opposed to simpler and more elegant languages.  Many design patterns emerged as ways to do things that aren't specifically considered in Java's Way Of Doing Things.  And that is what frustrates me about them: I'd really rather just use a language where it is easy to do what I want to get done.

Of course, I'm not going to get into a discussion of the advantages of strictly constrained ways of doing things, or dynamic versus static typing, or anything like that.  Suffice it to say: I understand there are advantages.  However, these advantages don't do much to reconsile my enjoyment as a programmer.  And I admit: I'm a little selfish that way.

By the way, the picture for this article is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_with_Popplers">Poppler</a>.  There was a problem with them too, but it is not related to the problem discussed in this article.

<div class="post post-/2008/06/19/javascript-the-deal-with">
  <div class="entrybody">
    <p>Most people don't seem to use the === operater in JavaScript.  Some lists of JavaScript operators don't even include it.  It is not as useless as the community's negligence would suggest.  There are times when it can be used to write more precise code.   So what does it do, anyway?</p>
<p>== asks: Are these the same value?  ("500" == 500) is true though one is a string and one is a number.<br />
=== asks: Are these the same type <strong>and</strong> the same value?  (500 === 500) is true, but the above is not.<br />
Both operators ask: "Are these the same object?" in the case of object comparison.</p>
<p>Some of the implications are subtle.</p>
<p>Primatives and the objects that represent them are different types with the same value.<br />
(5 == new Number(5)) is true.<br />
(5 === new Number(5)) is false.</p>
<p>Undefined and null are different types but have the same value.<br />
(null == undefined) is true.<br />
(null === undefined) is false.</p>
<p>False has the same value as primatives that evaluate to false.<br />
(false == 0) is true.<br />
(false === 0) is false.</p>
<p>True does <strong>not</strong> have the same value as primatives that evaluate to true.<br />
(true == "Greg") is false.<br />
(true === "Greg") is false.</p>
<p>Being aware of the difference will let you better understand your code's behavior, and allow you to pick the right operator for the job.</p>
<p>For example, use (arg === undefined) to check if an optional argument was provided.  If you use (!arg) or (arg == undefined) some odd things might happen, like explicit null being treated as an omitted argument.</p>
<p>Know that saying "if (foo)" and "if (foo == true)" and "if (foo === true)" are all different. (Try setting foo to each of 5, true, and new Boolean(true))</p>
<p>Always use the strictest operator possible.  Use looser operaters when you're sure you want to allow the "fuzzier" behavior.  === is very strict, so it is a good tool to have in the old toolbelt.</p>

  <h2 class="title"><a href="/2008/06/17/opera-95-review.html">Opera 9.5 Review</a></h2> 
<div class="post post-/2008/06/17/opera-95-review">
  <div class="entrybody">
    As an <a title="Opera" href="http://opera.com">Opera</a> user, I was one of the few people excited about their recent 9.5 release.  Overall it is a good release, though I'm going to start with the bad news first in a second.  I'm going to discuss things from my perspective rather than cover all the features in the change log one by one, so your mileage may vary.

The new UI design initially got the thumbs up from me, because I love dark and sleek, but it turns out the usability is not so impressive.  Removing all the icon colors makes them less recognizable, the tab close buttons are smaller and harder to click, and the new tab button defaults to the right of the tabs, where its location continuously changes as tabs are added or removed.  This can all be changed by the user, and in my mind, must be.  As pretty as the dark icons look at a casual glance, this is not a change for the better.  It looks like a lot of these changes were meant to look good in Vista.  The previous default theme wasn't OS-specific though, which I think is a better approach.  Also, Opera said that the new tab button to the right of the tabs would be familiar to IE users.  It is OK to make changes to ease the transition for new users, but you should only do so when you're not harming your own product.  Microsoft, well, isn't the best group to look to when it comes to UI design. The original theme, which you can still get for Opera 9.5, has clean blue tabs, soft grays, and occasional pale yellow highlights.  I have the feeling Opera will bring this back, or try something very different for their next major release.

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/picture-2.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-22" title="Opera 9.5 Mail Client" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/picture-2-300x232.png" alt="" width="300" height="232" /></a>

On the bright side, my favorite features are still here, occasionally with subtle improvements.  The ability to make a search out of any form field, the tab trash can, the way it opens with my tabs from last time, are all great.  I know Firefox has since adopted some of these features, but I still get the feeling Opera is paving the new ground with these little niceties.

I am the only person I know of who likes Opera's mail client, but sadly the previous release had a bug that made me unable to read emails from a certain other person.  This was a deal breaker, and I had been using Thunderbird until this release.  The bug is now fixed, and I now have a good feeling of Opera vs. Thunderbird for a mail client.  Thunderbird seems, well, a little lame.  I prefer Opera's Search Don't Sort mentality, which GMail has already proven to me to be the superior method of mail organization over folders and filing.  Opera mail's search is damned fast.  I did the same search in Opera and Thunderbird over about 20,000 messages.  Opera found it in about a second, Thunderbird took maybe 20 seconds.  It is kind of a requirement for this mail paradigm, but is probably something any Thunderbird user would appreciate.

That isn't the only fast thing in Opera.  It just feels fast in general.  Some of the benchmarks I've seen seem to support this feeling.  The trade-off seems to be that about once a month Opera falls flat on its face and dies.  Well, I haven't used Firefox or Internet Explorer enough lately to know if this is more or less often than those browsers.  But it isn't a big deal:  Opera comes right back up in the same state I left it.

My beef with the new theme and icon set doesn't reach every corner of the usability picture.  There are some smart changes too.  The left panel that carries default panels like mail, contacts, history, page information, and so on is now opened and closed by a button on the tool bar rather than a narrow strip along the side of the browser.  Much better.  Apparently new panels can be downloaded and added, but I haven't felt the need.

Another feature worth mentioning is "Opera Link", which synchronizes your settings and bookmarks between installations of Opera.  I believe Firefox plug-ins that do this have abounded lately, so it's nice to finally have that feature in Opera.  My bookmark list is much more interesting and useful than it used to be, as I never really settled on any bookmarking service like del.icio.us.

Overall I'm happy with what I got.  The new major features are great, there are some little tweaks here and there, the funky theme is surmountable with their peachy theme chooser, and I still feel a a little pang of joy when my browser treats a torrent link as a regular download, along with my normal downloads.  It's surprising that only <a title="Browser Stats" href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp">1.4%</a> of people that use this thing.  Maybe it is because Opera focuses so much on the mobile world, and interesting contracts like <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/devices/nintendo/">Opera for Wii</a>.  Probably the lack of a massive operating system that installs you by default, or an amazingly devout Free software community.  In any case, I like what I got with this release.
