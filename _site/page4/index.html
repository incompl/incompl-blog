Wow.  I get no commitment pricing with a 2-year commitment!  And as a valued customer, I get a discounted upgrade at a higher price.

It is like no one even read this to make sure it made sense, or is just doing a terrible job trying to make me feel like their miserable offer is a favor of some kind.

<a href="http://repper.studioludens.com/">This pattern creator</a> is neat, but I'm curious about their use of <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>. Can (or should) you really apply a Creative Commons license to the output of this kind of tool? To me it seems akin to if Adobe said that they have a license for anything you create with Photoshop.

For a long time, e-commerce sites were prohibitively annoying to set up. <a href="http://blog.weebly.com/2/post/2009/05/announcing-weebly-e-commerce-features.html">Weebly's new features</a> are one of the reasons that this is no longer the case.

    I have never filled out a product survey.  Until today.  Let's look at why this one is so good:

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/gameflysurvey.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-318" title="Gamefly Survey" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/gameflysurvey.png" alt="Gamefly Survey" width="488" height="346" /></a>

This survey is:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Short</strong>.  From just a glance I can tell I am 1 click away from finishing the survey.  The start of a survey of unknown length that scrolls off the page is far less inviting.</li>
	<li><strong>Relevant to my life</strong>.  How quickly games appear in the mail is something I actually care about.</li>
	<li><strong>Showing interest</strong>.  It says "Hey, did you get that game we sent you?" rather than a less personal "Rate our service on a scale of 1 to 10."</li>
</ul>
In addition to my being pleased with it, I'm sure <a href="http://www.gamefly.com/">GameFly</a> gets useful data from these.

How do you make a better organizational tool than a list?  Adding features generally adds friction, and since the list is already fully functional,  the first trade-off made to add a single feature is probably not worth it.  Unless you do it exactly right.

This is why until lately I've simply used text files for my lists.  There are tons of applications out there for keeping organized, but none of them seem to offer features that balance out the additional effort to use them. <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/">Backpack from 37signals</a> outdoes the text file.  The software is expressive, flexible, and simple.  Through legendary attention to detail, sweating the small stuff, and resisting the urge to unnecessarily complicate, their software matches the usefulness of the mighty text file.

This software has been around for awhile, though, and until now I have never used it regularly.  What changed?  Now, after all the work put into being as good as a text file, now there is a way in which it is better: access on my iPhone via <a href="http://standalone.com/iphone/satchel/">Satchel</a>.  Satchel is dead simple, nicely organized, and easy to use.  Now that I can access my lists from more places than I could with a plain text file, I have reason to change to Backpack.

Backpack has a free version, and Satchel is $9.99 on the iPhone app store.  Give them a try!

An <a href="http://lovelypackage.com/shefa-young-wine/">excellent wine label</a>.  Buying wine by the label actually isn't an awful idea.   I always feel like people who care about making an excellent product also care more about making it look presentable.

I like this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jxdSfKYE1s"> music video</a>.  Sometimes creativity comes from limitations.

Can you guess how big <a href="http://www.switcheasy.com/products/ThumbTacks/ThumbTacks.php">this</a> is by its shape?  A visual metaphor can communicate something other than function yet still be effective and fun.

I went through <a href="http://pets-area.com/index.php?option=com_photos&amp;view=photo&amp;id=654">every single one of these</a>.  I have no regrets.  It is here that I found the <a href="http://pets-area.com/images/users/2/3e07f376d0f3a43cbddc995ed6146ad2.jpg">best image ever</a>.

<div class="post post-/2009/04/10/my-favorite-wmp-bug">
  <div class="entrybody">
    Found a very interesting bug in Windows Media Player (WMP).  An embedded player will fail to play if the URL of the page it is embedded into is too long.

This is fun because you can see this on any website.  I have only tried this in Firefox and Internet Explorer 7 on Windows, but compare these URLs:

<a href="http://www.mediacollege.com/video/format/windows-media/streaming/embed-examples.html">Page with short URL</a>

The WMP APIs are pretty embarrassing, but for me, this one takes the cake.

<div class="post post-/2008/12/30/being-reddited">
  <div class="entrybody">
    I've often wondered what it looks like when a completely unknown site enjoys some social media popularity.  So when my one-night project <a href="http://jsregex.com">jsregex</a> was on its way to the <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a> front page, I threw some analytics on there to see what happens.  If you're curious too, here is the data.

This is for a site that received 269 points (413 up, 144 down) and had no prior traffic.

<img class="size-full wp-image-211" title="jsranalytics" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/jsranalytics.png" alt="Unique Visitors per Day" width="212" height="127" />

Unique Visitors per Day

That sums up to about 17,000 visitors, while still receiving a few hundred per day.

I also have analytics on this blog, which was discreetly linked to from jsregex.  This site receives almost no traffic, and is only occasionally perused by some of my friends.  Here is the data:

<img class="size-full wp-image-212" title="incomplanalytics" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/incomplanalytics.png" alt="Unique Visits per Day" width="207" height="125" />

Unique Visitors per Day

Still a fairly small number: looks like roughly 0.3% of visitors clicked through to my blog.

Of course, I also have <a href="http://feedburner.com">feedburner</a>:

<img class="size-full wp-image-213" title="incomplfb" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/incomplfb.png" alt="RSS Subscribers per Day" width="172" height="120" />

RSS Subscribers per Day

So roughly 13% of visitors to this blog went on to subscribe via RSS.  That is actually fairly good.  It probably helped that my most recent article was JavaScript related. [Edit: Later data showed about double what is shown here]

So now I know.  It was also fairly fun going through the referrals and finding all kinds of interesting sites, from social media mashups, to blogs in Japanese, Spanish, and other languages, to rip-offs of major sites like <a href="http://popurls.com">popurls</a>.

And if you're one of those new subscribers: hello there!  I hope you find something interesting here from time to time.
