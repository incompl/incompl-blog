<div class="post post-/2012/06/12/new-in-boxbox">
  <div class="entrybody">
    <p><a href='http://incompl.github.com/boxbox/'>boxbox</a>, my JavaScript framework for making 2d physics-based games with <a href='http://box2d.org/'>box2d</a>, has come a long way. If you haven&#8217;t seen it before, <a href='http://weblog.bocoup.com/introducing-boxbox/'>this tutorial</a> covers the basics. In this article I&#8217;m going to quickly cover some of what&#8217;s new and where boxbox is headed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been building a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania'>Castlevania</a>-like platform game with boxbox, and my experience building a real game has been the main factor informing my design decisions.</p>

<h3 id='making_boxbox_more_like_a_framework'>Making boxbox more like a framework</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve made the switch from calling boxbox a library to calling it a framework. boxbox is becoming more capable as the infrastructure that houses a game, rather than simply a tool to use while making a game.</p>

<h4 id='init'>init</h4>

<p>An interesting question I&#8217;ve considered while designing boxbox is this: when should something be an entity option, when should it be a method, and when should it be both? For example, event handlers are added via methods and currently must be attached after an entity is created. Is this ideal?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still pondering this question, so in the meantime I&#8217;ve added <code>init</code>. It&#8217;s useful in general, but it also lets me punt around this design decision by attaching event handlers in the <code>init</code> function.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='nx'>world</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>createEntity</span><span class='p'>({</span>
  <span class='nx'>init</span><span class='o'>:</span> <span class='kd'>function</span><span class='p'>()</span> <span class='p'>{</span>
    <span class='k'>this</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>applyImpulse</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='mi'>10</span><span class='p'>);</span> <span class='c1'>// jump immediately after being created</span>
  <span class='p'>}</span>
<span class='p'>});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<h4 id='custom_properties'>Custom properties</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve often said that a useful pattern when using boxbox would be to have your own model objects that contain boxbox entities. That way you could do your own domain logic and delegate to the boxbox entity when necessary. In practice, this sucks. As I tried it, it just felt like a bunch of extra effort that I shouldn&#8217;t have to do. What felt natural was using the boxbox entities for everything.</p>

<p>After trying a few ideas, I&#8217;m currently liking what I&#8217;m calling &#8220;custom properties&#8221;. This one might seem a little odd, but hear me out, because it&#8217;s a very practical approach. When creating a boxbox entity, options that start with <code>$</code> are not treated as a boxbox options, they&#8217;re simply passed along as properties on the resulting entity.</p>

<p>Here is an example of implementing a damageable object using custom properties:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='kd'>var</span> <span class='nx'>enemy</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='nx'>world</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>createEntity</span><span class='p'>({</span>
  <span class='nx'>x</span><span class='o'>:</span> <span class='mi'>5</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='c1'>// boxbox option</span>
  <span class='nx'>y</span><span class='o'>:</span> <span class='mi'>10</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='c1'>// boxbox option</span>
  <span class='nx'>$hp</span><span class='o'>:</span> <span class='mi'>10</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='c1'>// custom property</span>
  <span class='nx'>$damage</span><span class='o'>:</span> <span class='kd'>function</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nx'>amount</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='p'>{</span> <span class='c1'>// custom property (in this case, a method)</span>
    <span class='k'>this</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>$hp</span> <span class='o'>-=</span> <span class='nx'>amount</span><span class='p'>;</span>
    <span class='k'>if</span> <span class='p'>(</span><span class='k'>this</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>$hp</span> <span class='o'>&lt;=</span> <span class='mi'>0</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='p'>{</span>
      <span class='k'>this</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>destroy</span><span class='p'>();</span>
    <span class='p'>}</span>
  <span class='p'>}</span>
<span class='p'>});</span>
<span class='nx'>enemy</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>$damage</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='mi'>5</span><span class='p'>);</span> <span class='c1'>// entity is not destroyed</span>
<span class='nx'>enemy</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>$damage</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='mi'>5</span><span class='p'>);</span> <span class='c1'>// entity is destroyed</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;m not 100% committed to this system, but so far I like using it.</p>

<h3 id='patching_box2d'>Patching box2d</h3>

<p>box2d has some behaviors I don&#8217;t really like. These may or may not be &#8220;bugs&#8221; but they do add complexity I&#8217;d prefer to sidestep.</p>

<h4 id='events_on_destroyed_entities'>Events on destroyed entities</h4>

<p>By default, box2d may continue to trigger events for entities that were recently destroyed. boxbox now prevents these events.</p>

<h4 id='object_creation_in_event_handlers'>Object creation in event handlers</h4>

<p>box2d does not allow object creation in event handlers. The world is &#8220;locked&#8221; at that time. This is disruptive to healthy event-driven programming patterns. boxbox will automatically queue object creation if the world is locked. So far the effect is seamless.</p>

<p>This example shows an entity that creates another entity in an event handler. It&#8217;s easy to see how this could be expanded into a &#8220;respawn&#8221; system. Until recently, this code would throw an exception.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='kd'>var</span> <span class='nx'>enemy</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='nx'>world</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>createEntity</span><span class='p'>({</span>
  <span class='c1'>// options here </span>
<span class='p'>});</span>
<span class='nx'>enemy</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>onImpact</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='kd'>function</span><span class='p'>()</span> <span class='p'>{</span>
  <span class='k'>this</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>destroy</span><span class='p'>();</span>
  <span class='nx'>world</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>createEntity</span><span class='p'>({</span>
    <span class='c1'>// options here</span>
  <span class='p'>}});</span>
<span class='p'>});</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id='event_changes'>Event changes</h3>

<h4 id='onrender'>onRender</h4>

<p><code>onRender</code> isn&#8217;t new, but now it can be attached to entities as well as worlds. The value of <code>this</code> in the callback will be appropriate based on which it was attached to.</p>

<h4 id='ontick'>onTick</h4>

<p><code>onTick</code> is new, attachable to both entities and worlds. This allows boxbox to manage your game loop. Ticks are events that happen at a regular interval, default every 50 milliseconds, configurable with the <code>tickFrequency</code> option on your world. <code>onTick</code> is something I have thought about since boxbox was created, but I&#8217;m implementing it now due to my decision for boxbox to become a framework rather than a simple library.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to use <code>onRender</code> only for drawing things to the canvas, while using <code>onTick</code> for game logic. <code>onRender</code> is optimized by <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.requestAnimationFrame'>requestAnimationFrame</a> and may not occur at a constant rate, but it’s called once per frame drawn to the canvas. <code>onTick</code> is called regularly regardless of the current framerate.</p>

<h3 id='rendering'>Rendering</h3>

<h4 id='sprite_sheet_support'>Sprite sheet support</h4>

<p>Most 2d games use sprite sheets for animation. They&#8217;re images <a href='http://www.nes-snes-sprites.com/ImagesSheet/FinalFantasy3Sheet1.gif'>like this</a> that contain all the different frames of an animation or multiple animations.</p>

<p>In boxbox you can use an entity&#8217;s image as a spritesheet by adding a couple extra parameters.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='kd'>var</span> <span class='nx'>player</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='nx'>world</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>createEntity</span><span class='p'>({</span>
  <span class='nx'>image</span><span class='o'>:</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;player.png&quot;</span><span class='p'>,</span>
  <span class='nx'>spriteSheet</span><span class='o'>:</span> <span class='kc'>true</span><span class='p'>,</span>
  <span class='nx'>spriteWidth</span><span class='o'>:</span> <span class='mi'>16</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='c1'>// the width, in pixels, of a single sprite</span>
  <span class='nx'>spriteHeight</span><span class='o'>:</span> <span class='mi'>16</span> <span class='c1'>// same but height</span>
<span class='p'>});</span>
<span class='nx'>player</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>sprite</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='mi'>0</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='mi'>2</span><span class='p'>);</span> <span class='c1'>// set the image to column 0, row 2 in the spritesheet</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You might notice that boxbox doesn&#8217;t support spritesheets that are not based on grids. That&#8217;s for simplicity, and it may change.</p>

    Over the course of a project I'm working on I've run into a few really weird JavaScript behaviors. This is one of them. It only happens with the <em>name</em> property, probably because of how names are handled for constructor functions.

<div class="post post-/2011/10/20/__proto__-is-not-constructor-prototype">
  <div class="entrybody">
    JavaScript's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/Proto">__proto__</a> property is extremely handy but non-standard and deprecated. I've seen a lot of people around the net saying that constructor.prototype can be used as an alternative to __proto__. At first they seem to be the same:
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">Foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Foo</span><span class="p">();</span>

</code></pre>
</div>

Unfortunately when you really start to dig in you find that they're not equivalent:
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">Parent</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">parent</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Parent</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">Child</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{}</span>
<span class="nx">Child</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">prototype</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">parent</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">child</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Child</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="c1">// child inherits directly from parent. this makes sense.</span>

<p>
This has become especially relevant lately with the introduction of __proto__'s weaker successor, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/GetPrototypeOf">getPrototypeOf</a>. It does what __proto__ does, but it's read-only, while setting the __proto__ property of an object is one of __proto's__ handy little charms.
</p><p>
Since not everyone supports getPrototypeOf yet, polyfills have been <a href="https://gist.github.com/1052392">popping</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/1022883">up</a> around the net that fall back to __proto__ and constructor.prototype. However, these polyfills are broken, because constructor.prototype just isn't the same thing. Adding to the confusion, <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/objectgetprototypeof/">John Resig's post</a> on getPrototypeOf insinuates that they're the same thing as well.
</p><p>
I'm glad that we're getting a standard way to access an object's prototype with getPrototypeOf. It's unfortunate all the polyfills I've seen aren't correct and I can't think of a way to polyfill below IE9. Anyone have any clever ideas?

I like to make DJ sets: compilations of electronic music combined into long seamless compositions. Though the individual songs are edited, warped, and layered, they are still copyrighted works by other artists, so distributing these sets is not necessarily legal. The powers that be seem to ignore the prevalent sharing of DJ sets online, but it has always bothered me that there isn't a legitimate way to share my work.
</p><p>
Enter <a href="http://mixcloud.com">Mixcloud</a>, which promises to solve this problem. Mixcloud allows users to upload and share podcasts, radio shows, and DJ sets. Impressively, <em>Mixcloud itself foots the bill for royalties</em>. They pay <strong>PRS for Music</strong> and <strong>PPL</strong> on behalf of their users.
</p><p>
In order to make this legally possible, there are a few reasonable restrictions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>audio can only be streamed, not downloaded</li>
	<li>sets must have at least  8 tracks</li>
	<li>full track lists must be provided</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition to these limits, there was a 100 mb limit on uploads, which did limit me on my audio quality. Still, the service is free, so it's pretty impressive that this is viable.
</p><p>
The requirement to include full track lists is not just a burden. This required metadata allows for some interesting features, such as the ability to search for DJ sets that include a particular song. This is not something I've seen before and it certainly is a fun way to search for new music. Additionally, an uploader can easily mark the start times of each track in a set, and the player helpfully highlights the currently playing song.
</p><p>
How does Mixcloud make money from this? Two ways that I can see:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ads. The site has ugly banner ads, but hey, at least they're not kidding themselves about the need to generate revenue.</li>
	<li>Affiliates? Mixcloud puts "Buy" links in track lists, allowing you to buy individual songs from sites such as Amazon, iTunes, Beatport, and Juno. It's possible they make money from these referrals.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Founded in 2008, Mixcloud has received two grants from the <a href="http://www.innovateuk.org/">Technology Strategy Board</a>, the UK’s national innovation agency. They're still running lean with only 4 employees, but if this business model is sustainable, they're really onto something here.

    <a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Kickstarter_logo.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1050" title="Kickstarter_logo" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Kickstarter_logo-300x81.jpg" alt="Kickstarter logo" width="240" height="65" /></a>

I recently raised $743 in donations to my side-project, a web-based game titled <a href="http://startcontinue.com">91</a>. I used the fund-raising site <a href="http://kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> and the experience was delightful and fascinating. Here is how it happened.
</p><p>
I’ve been working on 91 for about a year. The first post on the game’s blog was on 11/27/2009 but I had been working on the game before that, though I’m not sure when coding actually began. Many of the ideas present in the game have been brewing in my head for several years.
</p><p>
I had been looking at Kickstarter just out of curiosity. It’s an interesting site: users create projects that they want to get funded by donations. These projects are usually creative and include art, theater, music, writing, and of course games. Each project has a deadline and a funding goal, usually measured in thousands of dollars. Each project is funded only if the goal is met. If the goal is not met, no money changes hands. The idea here is that if a project requires the full amount in order to become reality, then no one should have to donate to a project that doesn’t meet its goal and cannot be completed.
</p><p>
An additional feature is that projects are required to have rewards. If a project is successfully funded, donors may receive a reward based on how much they donated. This adds an additional incentive and personal touch to each project. Project creators can choose whatever rewards they’d like.
</p><p>
It seems to me that Kickstarter has several functions. One, they handle all the money, which is nice. Second, they’re a trusted name, so having a Kickstarter project gives you a certain authenticity that makes people less skeptical about donating. Further, they’re offering their promotion and their marketing smarts. It’s not arbitrary that Kickstarter requires deadlines and rewards. These are known to be successful ways to raise money, and Kickstarter wants you to succeed. Kickstarter offers great advice throughout the process, and they also drive a fair amount of traffic to your project, especially if you’re featured on their home page. In exchange, Kickstarter takes 5% of what you raise.
</p><p>
So, I decided to raise some money. There is one little inconsistency here: isn’t Kickstarter for potential projects that need money to begin? My game isn't complete, but it's already underway. Well, my idea passed Kickstater’s approval process, so they seem to be flexible. My goal was to cover costs I’ve incurred while developing the game, which are not completely negligible. This money isn't for personal use, excluding of course pizza deliveries during late-night coding sessions. My costs for my first year developing 91 look like this:
</p><p>
<ul>
	<li>LunarPages Hosting (12 months) $107</li>
	<li>LunarPages Domain Registration (1 year) $20</li>
	<li>Github (12 months) $84</li>
	<li>Coda (software) $99</li>
	<li>iShowU HD (software) $30</li>
	<li>12 silly sunglasses (Kickstarter reward) $13</li>
	<li>20 custom postcards from <a href="http://moo.com">moo.com</a> (Kickstarter reward) $20</li>
	<li>VectorDesigner (software to create postcard graphics) $30</li>
	<li>12 custom booklets from <a href="http://lulu.com">lulu.com</a> (Kickstarter reward) $64</li>
	<li>Concept art commission (Kickstarter promotion) $60</li>
</ul>
Total: $527
</p><p>
This works out to be very close to what I chose as my project goal, $500. I decided to see if I could raise this much money in 30 days, from 1/8/2011 to 2/7/2011.
</p><p>
The question of what to offer as rewards was an interesting one. I looked at other successful projects for ideas. The sunglasses were the idea of a friend of mine. Here are the rewards I used. Each reward includes all the rewards from the lower tiers.
</p><p>
<strong>$10 or more: Get your name / url posted on http://startcontinue.com/community/thanks</strong>
</p><p>
The idea here was to try to get people to donate at least $10. There were still 5 people who donated less than $10 and didn’t get any reward.
</p>
<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/rewards.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1059" title="rewards" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/rewards-300x226.jpg" alt="A photo of the rewards I sent out to Kickstarter supporters" width="300" height="226" /></a>
<p>
<strong>$25 or more: A booklet with a short story about the game and a postcard with a map of the city the game takes place in.</strong>
</p><p>
This seemed to be the reward people were most interested in. I believe that in general Kickstarter backers want creative and personalized rewards related to the project they’re donating to.
</p><p>
<strong>$50 or more: In addition, get sweet neon sunglasses, and your character in-game starts with sweet sunglasses.</strong>
</p><p>
Either because the reward was lame or because $50 is not a compelling donation quantity, only one person donated at this level.
</p><p>
<strong>$100 or more: In addition, you get an NPC named after you in the game, and your name/link goes in the startcontinue.com footer.</strong>
</p><p>
To my surprise and delight, four people donated at this level. It’s hard to say if the rewards were a factor, because these are some awesome and generous people either way.
</p><p>
<strong>$500 or more: I’ll fly to wherever you are and buy you a beer in person. Limit 1, first come first serve.</strong>
</p><p>
This wasn’t my idea, there actually was another project that offered this reward. It was a sort of a joke to begin with, honestly. No one donated at this level.
</p><p>
Another thing Kickstarter suggests is making a video to explain your project. Your video is featured right at the top of your project page. I thought about taking a lot of time to make a high-quality video, but I didn’t want to waste the effort if I was only going to get $30 of pledges. I made a quick video demonstrating the game, figuring that I could always make a better one later, which I never did. Besides, the game can speak for itself. People know a game they want to play if they see it, right?
</p><p>
With that all determined I started the project, totally unsure of if anyone would be interested in donating. I wouldn’t have been surprised if the project received no attention and ended with mere pocket-change in pledges.
</p><p>
Donations trickled in for the first week. I posted the project on social media sites such as <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> and <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a> and some forums such as <a href="http://roguetemple.com/forums/">Roguetemple</a>. This generated enough interest to raise my first $100. During this time it looked like the I may or may not make my goal, depending on if I could keep up the pace.
</p><p>
During the second week, the project stagnated. I had posted to all the forums and sites I thought were relevant, and didn’t want to get spammy. I considered making a new, better video to promote the game, and probably would have if this kept up. I also commissioned some concept art to help promote the game and make the project more eye-catching.
</p><p>
After January 18th something interesting happened. People started to notice 91. There was some discussion about the game on <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">rockpapershotgun.com</a>’s forums around this time, which drove more interest and traffic than I expected. Also, a couple more predominant members of the gaming community started to donate generously and help promote the game. It seems that the best way to get attention is to get mentioned in the right forums or social news sites, and to get noticed by the right people. With new people helping to promote, 91 was mentioned in new places and new avenues of traffic opened up. Not just that, it was the right kind of traffic, as these people were donating at higher levels.
</p><p>
Thanks to this, I suddenly met my goal in a matter of days. It was a really exciting time! This is where I stopped worrying about promotion and started working on the rewards I’d need to send out.
</p>
<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/91-on-kickstarter-home-page.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1053" title="91 on kickstarter home page" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/91-on-kickstarter-home-page.png" alt="Screen shot of 91 on the kickstarter.com home page" width="262" height="238" /></a>
<p>
On January 28th another interesting thing happened. 91 was featured on the kickstarter.com home page. This drove a great amount of traffic. During this time I got around 250 referrals to startcontinue.com from Kickstarter, which is only a subset of the number of people who visited the Kickstarter project page. Since these are people who clicked-through from the project page, these were 250 people who had looked at the project page and wanted to learn more.
</p><p>
91 was featured on Kickstarter’s home page again a few days later, driving another 150 referrals to startcontinue.com.
</p><p>
On February 1st 91 was featured in an article on <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/">pcgamer.com</a> titled “10 games you can help fund now.” The article was later taken down; I’m not sure why. I do have a backup of it. The article was very sarcastic, probably in response to some of the projects that were featured, some of which were asking for a lot of money with little to show for themselves. One commenter went so far as to suggest that all of these projects were scams. Well, maybe some of them were, if they weren’t simply misled or overly-ambitious. At least I felt vindicated by this: the author starts describing 91 by saying “You’ve got to have a soft spot for roguelikes, and developers who aren’t deluded, greedy bastards.” They give a quick overview of the game and seem generally positive. However, they switch back to sarcasm, and conjecture that my reward of flying out to buy a beer for the $500 donor was an attempt to get a free holiday. The article ends: “Greedy bastard!” I have the feeling that this was all in good fun, but I admit I was a little confused at the time, especially given the more earnest disdain being doled out nearby. It’s not clear to me if this exposure led to any contributions.
</p><p>
On February 7th the funding period closed. The project was a great success, reaching 149% of its goal (yes, you keep whatever you raise above the goal) with $743 total. I was quite pleased, but actually felt a bit pressured too. Suddenly my little side-project had actual expectations attached to it for the first time.
</p><p>
Once the funding period closed I started organizing my rewards. Kickstarter lets you send out surveys to automatically collect the information needed from backers, such as their shipping addresses. The sunglasses I ordered on Amazon: that was easy.  I ordered the custom postcards from moo.com, which prints them in multiples of 20, so I have some extras. I ordered the booklets from lulu.com and they turned out beautiful. I had everything shipped to my apartment so I could combine them, add some personal touches, and ship a single packet to each backer. One thing I didn’t think about was international shipping costs, but only a couple of backers were international so it was manageable.
</p><p>
One lesson I learned is that I’m not much of a marketer. 91 is a unique game and it’s hard to tell exactly who would be interested in it, but I missed the mark, and never thought to post in some of the forums that ended up being very interested in the game. Also, since certain people ended up being extremely helpful in promoting the game, if I did this again I’d send emails (or maybe tweets?) to influential members of the gaming community right off the bat, telling them about the game and asking not for donations but for help promoting the project. Of course, I’d send personal emails only to people I thought would be genuinely interested in the game based on what I knew about them. I don’t think any less personal emails or mass-marketing is likely to work and could even harm goodwill.
</p><p>
Another thing I learned is that having a working demo was crucial to my success. Many people are skeptical of Kickstarter projects that promise the world but don’t have convincing credentials suggesting that the project will be a success. I didn’t have to prove much to anyone: people who wanted to know what I was capable of could just play the work-in-progress and see it for themselves.
</p><p>
Another interesting fact is that some people thought I was being greedy. My Kickstarter page mentioned that I do this in my spare time and that I do have a day job, so some people said they saw no reason to donate to me since I didn’t need the money. That’s true, I’m not a starving artist trying to put food on the table. And certainly, those types of people should get money before I should. But still, I think anyone who creates art, be it video games or novels or paintings, is putting their heart and soul into their work, not to mention their time and money. There is nothing wrong with people who enjoy such art giving something back. Would these people think any differently if I charged for the game instead of asking for donations? Would it be different if I was making a different type of game than a roguelike, most of which are free? It’s hard to say.
</p><p>
Overall this was a great experience. At this point I’m not developing 91 at a personal financial loss. Much better, though, is all the people I’ve met and talked to throughout the process. I’ve gotten a lot of great feedback on the game and it’s really encouraging seeing that people are interested in my work. My plan now is to keep at it. The game came a long way in its first year. I’m hoping that in another year it’ll be done. We’ll see how it goes! If you want to learn more about 91, visit <a href="http://startcontinue.com">http://startcontinue.com</a>.

For some reason, all over the Internet people preload images like this:

There is no reason for this code to be two lines. I preload my images like this:

It would be hard to come up with a more minor nitpick than this, but if we're going to write this code hundreds of times during our lives, why not keep it simple?

  <h2 class="title"><a href="/2010/09/20/catching-jquery-ajax-json-parse-error.html">Catching jQuery AJAX JSON Parse Error</a></h2> 
<div class="post post-/2010/09/20/catching-jquery-ajax-json-parse-error">
  <div class="entrybody">
    <p>
Today I found an interesting bug in my jQuery code. My app was reporting "You are offline: check your Internet connection" but Firebug was reporting the 200 success status code for the request. Turns out that I had a syntax error in the JSON file I was pulling down. Fair enough, that is certainly an error, it's just that my log message was wrong. So I went into my <a href="http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/"><em>ajaxError</em></a> function to fix it.
</p><p>
Here is where I got a bit confused. Though <em>ajaxError</em> has several helpful arguments, none of them seemed to identify when a JSON parse error had occurred. After Googling around a bit, I found <a href="http://www.maheshchari.com/jquery-ajax-error-handling/">a helpful example</a> of the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/"><em>ajaxSetup</em></a> function. <em>ajaxSetup</em> lets you define an error function too. At first I assumed this was the same as <em>ajaxError</em>, but it turns out that the <em>ajaxSetup</em> error function is called, then the <em>ajaxError</em> function is called, on each AJAX error.
</p><p>
More importantly, the error function defined in <em>ajaxSetup</em> does more to identify the source of the problem. Here is the gist of the code I ended up writing:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ajaxSetup</span><span class="p">({</span>

<div class="post post-/2010/09/19/checking-javascript-function-argument-types">
  <div class="entrybody">
    The <em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Special_Operators/typeof_Operator">typeof</a></em> operator in JavaScript can be a little misleading. Here is an example of using it to check the type of a function argument.
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

So far so good. However, in JavaScript a "String" can be either a value <em>or</em> a String object. What happens if we pass in a String object?
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">String</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;dog&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="s2">&quot;foo dog&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// exception thrown!</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

Woops! That is definitely not what we want.

Sadly, there is nothing built into JavaScript that is perfect for this situation. But consider the following alternative. This version was borrowed from  <a href="http://dmitry.baranovskiy.com/post/typeof-and-friends">Dmitry Baranovskiy</a> but there are a few similar functions around the net.

Now we're getting what we want! As with <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html">object instantiation</a>, this is a case where what's built into the language just doesn't cut it, but if you understand what you'd prefer and why, you can definitely get what you need.

I was reading <a href="http://books.alistapart.com/product/html5-for-web-designers">HTML5 for Web Designers</a> and was reminded again of the interesting debate about autofocus and keyboard shortcuts. If you're unfamiliar, autofocus is a JavaScript technique for automatically putting the cursor in a particular form element when a user visits a web page. This happens when you visit <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>: notice that you can just start typing without manually clicking in the search box first.
</p><p>
The concern that many people have is that autofocus impedes the use of certain keyboard shortcuts. Awhile ago on Twitter I noticed that <a href="http://perfectionkills.com/">Juriy Zaytsev</a> (a prolific JavaScript blogger and <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype.js</a> core developer)  <a href="http://twitter.com/kangax/status/15114069104">said</a> that autofocus breaks the <em>backspace</em> button, which is a shortcut for <em>back</em>. In the aforementioned book I'm reading, the author suggests that you should think long and hard before using autofocus, since it breaks use of the <em>space</em> key to scroll down the page. In both cases, autofocus causes these keys to type or delete in the selected form element instead of executing the shortcut's intended function.
</p><p>
It's a shame that these prominent folks are dissuading people from using autofocus. Autofocus really is a time-saver. The real problem is <strong>bad keyboard shortcuts</strong>.
</p><p>
Keyboard shortcuts that are too likely to confuse the user and produce the wrong result are a bad idea. I'd argue that using <em>backspace</em> or <em>spacebar</em> as a keyboard shortcut is almost as harmful as using <em>p</em> or <em>b</em>. <em>Keys that indicate that the user may be trying to type something should not be used as shortcuts</em>. Unless paired with one of alt, control, option, etc.
</p><p>
The good news is that although there are some very common but very bad keyboard shortcuts available, you don't have to use them. If you want to stop being bothered by autofocus, I have found that Firefox, Opera, Chrome, and Safari all support <em>command-[</em> as an alternative to <em>backspace</em> that works even if a form element has focus. Further, <em>fn-downarrow</em> is a good alternatives to <em>spacebar</em> for scrolling down.
</p><p>
Start using good keyboard shortcuts! It'll keep you sane, and let web designers make use of helpful features like autofocus!
