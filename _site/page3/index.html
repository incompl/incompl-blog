I was breaking my own rule for awhile on this blog.
</p>
<blockquote>Every website should explain what it is, right off the bat.</blockquote>
<p>
I've added a new "Welcome" blurb to the right to amend this oversight.
</p><p>
It is easy to forget this rule, since this information is so obvious to the designer. But it is crucial: if a new visitor doesn't know what a site is for, and can't find out quickly, they'll often just leave.

    <p>
I just stopped by <a href="http://openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> to download their fine software. I hadn't seen their site for awhile, and while the current design is pretty nice, they made one tragic error that I can't help but point out. Here is the current design:
</p><p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-601" title="OOo" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/OOo.png" alt="" width="517" height="312" />
</p><p>
Everything you'd come to the site for, laid with convenient icons. However, for some reason, each of the main links in the body of the page is an entire sentence. If I'm looking for the download link, I just need to see "Download". The sentences add nothing, but they do make it harder to scan the page, since they distract from the key terms. Further, each line already has an explanation beneath it, if you're really not sure what the links do. I would have done it more like this:
</p><p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-603" title="OOo mine" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/OOo-mine.png" alt="" width="517" height="312" />
</p><p>
Much better. If you came here to get help, visually scanning the page will reveal the "Help" link instantly, instead of a couple seconds later. In web design, seconds matter.<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/OOo.png">

It was worded like this:
<blockquote>"On the back of this paper, write out every keystroke and mouseclick you would take to add five spaces at the beginning of the first 10 lines of a file in a text editor."</blockquote>
Naturally, some people protested. But he insisted that the literal meaning of the question was to be carried out.

Some students assumed it was a trick question that they didn't understand, and wrote nothing. Some students write out the entirety of what was necessary to do this in Notepad:
<blockquote>space, space, space, space, space, down, home, space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space, down, home,space, space, space, space, space</blockquote>
At the time, I had been learning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim</a> at the professor's advice. So, feeling very clever, I wrote this on the back of my paper:
<blockquote>:1,10s/^/     /</blockquote>
In a few days, when the exam was returned, students noticed that the this question had not been graded. The professor answered them:
<blockquote>"Your reward for getting it right is not having to write out an entire page of text to do something trivially simple. If you haven't followed my advice and learned a good text editor, you waste this much time a hundred times over every time you write a program."</blockquote>
Invaluable advice for any programmer. Use good tools, and get really good at using them.

  <h2 class="title"><a href="/2009/12/04/previews-in-music-stores.html">Previews in Music Stores</a></h2> 
<div class="post post-/2009/12/04/previews-in-music-stores">
  <div class="entrybody">
    <a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/trackitdown-player.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-532" title="trackitdown player" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/trackitdown-player.png" alt="trackitdown player" width="223" height="376" /></a>Song previews in music stores have always fascinated me. I remember when I first downloaded iTunes I wondered: how is the location of the preview in the song selected? Why 30 seconds? Most importantly, why can't the previews be better?

Thankfully, a lot of music sites I use <em>are</em> better, and are only improving. <a href="http://trackitdown.net">Trackitdown</a> recently upgraded their player (shown to the left) so you can play the entire song. Strangely, the song stops automatically after the normal preview length of a couple minutes. If you seek to a different part of the song, the preview window shortens to 30 seconds. But if you patiently click where you left off each time it stops, you can hear the whole song.

I don't think this is poor interface design. I think this is the result of compromise. Stores want to offer as much preview as they can (because consumers want it) but content providers (musicians, music labels, etc.) are afraid of giving away too much for free. Many iterations of "Well, what if we did <em>this</em>?" met with "Well... only if you limit it <em>this</em> way" must have led to the behaviors consumers are now familiar with.

The good news is that the music stores are making progress. Song previews have been gradually getting longer, higher quality, and more interactive with time. The Trackitdown player is a good example. Here are a couple other ones.

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/beatport-player4.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-561" title="beatport player" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/beatport-player4.png" alt="beatport player" width="475" height="73" /></a>

Above is the <a href="http://beatport.com">Beatport</a> player. The best (relatively recent) feature of this player is the queue on the right. As with Trackitdown, everywhere in the store where a song is shown, you can either play it immediately or add it to the preview queue. It is a great experience to shop by building up a queue, then sitting back and listening to long, high quality previews while doing something else for awhile, opening up Beatport when you like the current song. All previews are a couple minutes long, but the quality varies: I wonder if different content providers have different preview fidelity restrictions.

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/soundcloud-player.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-535" title="soundcloud player" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/soundcloud-player.png" alt="soundcloud player" width="467" height="65" /></a>

This one is the <a href="http://soundcloud.com">Soundcloud</a> player. This site isn't really a store: it lets people pay to have high quality hosting for music in order to promote it. This site demonstrates the waveform display that is showing up in many music stores. At first it might just seem like eye-candy, but waveforms have been in DJ tools for a long time because they're genuinely useful. If you're previewing a song, and it breaks down to a quiet bit, you may just want to visually identify the busy part get to the point. It's a great way to quickly triage songs if you don't want to listen to full 2 minute previews for everything.

I expect full-song previews to show up someday, with sound quality being the only incentive to pay up. This works well for selling stock images: some sites use watermarks, but others simply provide a lower-resolution version of the image as the preview. Let's hope the current trend continues at least: the more I know about a song, the more likely I am to feel confident enough to pay for it.

It is still in the works, but I've been posting to it as I work on it. It uses a couple interesting WordPress plugins to do the detailed classification: specifically, the fields and tag clouds for flavors, breweries, and beer styles.

The design is not mine, but my policy is to get the site running before spending a lot of time on that part. It'll be a great site to do a design for when I want some new portfolio material.

If you're a JavaScript programmer and haven't read any of his articles, head over to <a href="http://crockford.com">his site</a> and get started. It's more important than reading this blog.  Seriously.

Alright. I want to show an example he used that doesn't seem to be included in any of his articles online. This may not be exactly the same, but is close to how I remember it.

Everyone argues about where to put the starting curly-brace of a block.  Usually they don't have any substantial cause to pick one over the other, but everyone agrees one technique should be used consistently in a given program.  There is a reason to choose one style over the other in JavaScript. Check out this example:
<blockquote>
<pre>function test1() {
    return {
        foo: "bar"
    };
}

function test2()
{
    return
    {
        foo: "bar"
    };
}

alert(test1() === undefined); // false
alert(test2() === undefined); // true</pre>
</blockquote>
These two functions appear to only differ in their formatting.  Surprised by these results?

The first function does exactly what it looks like it should. In the second, 4 different language design problems cause the program to do something unexpected while providing no errors.
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_syntax#Whitespace_and_semicolons">Semi-colon insertion</a> causes the <em>return</em> to be a <em>return;</em></li>
	<li>A line that starts with <em>{</em> starts a block. There is no block-level scope, so in this case the block does nothing. This "feature" is only there because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> has it.</li>
	<li>The<em> foo: </em>looks like part of an object literal, but we're in a block, not an object literal. This should be an error, right? No, it's a label. Even though we're not in code where a label could do anything, such as a <em>for</em> loop.</li>
	<li>The rest of the line after the label is the value "bar". A value by itself counts as a statement, even though it doesn't do anything.</li>
</ol>
Wow. That function does something wildly different than what it appears to do. The point Crockford was making here was that in JavaScript, unlike in most languages, preferring the first type of curly-brace placement helps you avoid mistakes like this one.

He also mentioned that <a href="http://jslint.com/">JSLint</a>,  his free JavaScript code quality tool, is able to pick up on this kind of mistake. Try running my example through it!

<h2><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Never</span> Sometimes catch the top-level "Exception" class.</h2>
There are times when it is definitely appropriate.  Imagine some controller code in a web application.  An underlying system has produced an unexpected exception.  Controller code can't do anything to fix it, but allowing the exception to continue up the call stack would cause a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#5xx_Server_Error">500 error</a>.  Catching any thrown exception can allow the Controller to do something better, like output a message to the user notifying them of the error and making a suggestion on what to do next.

In short, catch the top-level Exception class if you know for sure that every thrown exception will be handled more poorly by your caller than you can handle it, and you can't improve the caller's behavior.
<h2><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Always</span> When appropriate catch the most  specific exceptions thrown.</h2>
Catching the most specific exceptions thrown is meant to create error handling specific to the problem that was raised.  For example, a "DatabaseConnectionLost" exception would be caught, and in the catch block the connection would be repaired.  It seems reasonable to always want to do this, but in practice, some exceptions are thrown in cases where you can't do anything about it.  Lets say a method throws "DatabaseConnectionLost" and "DatabaseQueryInvalid", both of which are children of "DatabaseException."  In a situation where the calling code can't repair the connection or fix the query, catching the parent is appropriate, rather than handling each specific case without anything specific to do.  If the code can do something like email the DBA, catching DatabaseException seems useful.

In short, you should always catch the most specific exceptions that you can actually do something about.
<h2>Never leave a catch block empty (if you can help it)</h2>
This is actually one of those rare never-ism that I'm OK with.  But sadly, when interfacing with poorly thought out code, sometimes you are forced to do this.

Lets say you want to create User objects and add them all to a list, and you know their IDs.  You can get users by ID from a piece of library code that you cannot change.  However, you cannot check if a user ID is valid: there is no method for it.  Further, the getUser method throws UserIdInvalidException when you try to get a user by an invalid ID.  For you, an invalid ID is not an exceptional circumstance, but the library code assumes it is.  Sadly you might be forced to write something like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>for (id : userIds) {</pre>
<pre>    try {</pre>
<pre>        users.add(UserLib.getUser(id));</pre>
<pre>    }</pre>
<pre>    catch (UserIdInvalidException e) {</pre>
<pre>        // If ID is invalid don't include it on the list</pre>
<pre>    }</pre>
<pre>}</pre>
</blockquote>
It is very rare that you actually can't find a better way.  For the most part, consider a catch block like this to be a mistake unless proven otherwise.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Forget all these "always" and "never" rules.  A rule to live by would read more like this:  Exceptions should always be handled as best they can by the code best suited to handle them.

    Decided to spruce up the design of this blog.  I wanted texture, and here it is!

Decided to not use any PNG transparency hacks and just let the browser do what it wants with what I throw at it.  As a result, the few visitors that are using IE6 will get less-than-ideal rendering.  I may add a "This page won't look right in IE6" message later.
