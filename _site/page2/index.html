    <a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/cwslogo-chrome.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-918" title="Chrome Web Store Logo" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/cwslogo-chrome.png" alt="The Chrome Web Store Logo" width="251" height="46" /></a>
<p>
I like the idea behind the newly-announced <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a>. It's a store for web apps, which technically aren't different from any other web sites like <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>. At first it feels like Google is just out to make a quick buck by mimicking Apple's successful <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/apps-for-iphone/">App Store</a>. However, I think something more subtle is going on here. This is a a totally different approach to making money on the web.
</p><p>
Every now and then I think about making money from my side projects, but I've never done it. Why? Because making money on the web is called "ads". If you're selling t-shirts you probably don't need ads, but if you want to make a website that's fun or useful on its own merits, you don't have a lot of options. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google#Advertising">Google makes 99% of its money from ads</a>. The problem? I hate ads.
</p><p>
Ads pit you against your users. A user's goal is just to use the app and have fun or perform some task. An advertiser's goal is to get impressions. Do you hate the new ad overlays in Youtube? We all do, but Google has to pay the bills for Youtube to be free. Ever clicked a link, only to discover it wasn't a link at all, it just triggered an irrelevant ad pop-up? They generate impressions. It's a bait and switch, but someone is willing to pay for it, and someone has to write a check to Bob's Discount Hosting at the end of the day.
</p><p>
Google has always known that people hate ads. That's why they've put so much work into making ads painless. Their text ads are low-bandwidth and unobtrusive. Now and then, they can even be useful. That's why Google is <a href="http://www.marketingvox.com/googles-ad-server-market-share-at-57-042692/">the clear leader in web advertising market share</a>. Though now Google is asking themselves a few questions. What would the web be like without ads? And where would Google fit into such a web?
</p><p>
Are there websites don't sell a more tangible product, don't have ads, and exist only to be fun or useful? Sure. <a href="http://jsregex.com">I made one</a>, but the cost to run it is negligible. What would happen if it started generating millions of views a day, and my hosting company raised my rate? I'd need to take the site down, or find a way to make money. Inevitably, this would mean slapping ads on it. Yuck. Tons of <a href="http://twitter.com/">interesting startups</a> live in the same bubble I live in. Let's just make a useful or fun app, and worry about money later, and only if we have to. With venture capital, you can live in this bubble for a long time. Sooner or later, though, reality sets in. Does this mean Twitter is going to have ads some day? Well, <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/04/hello-world.html">yes</a>. They're wrapping it up in a nice package, painfully aware of how much users hate ads, but that's what they're doing. That's what you <em>have</em> to do.
</p><p>
This is why iPhone development is so appealing. <a href="http://www.edibleapple.com/ifart-developer-makes-40000-in-2-days/">You can make money without ads</a>. Your app is just your app. I don't understand in the least why Apple thinks creating <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technologies/iphone/whats-new.html#iAd">an ad platform for iPhone apps</a> is a good idea. They must underestimate how much people hate ads. I cringed when Steve Jobs acted genuinely excited when announcing this stuff. iPhone developers will continue to make it big when they make good software at a good price point. It's such a better way.
</p><p>
As you think about all this, eventually you have to ask, why don't web apps work like iPhone apps? Why are the choices "free" or "ads"? 37signals is pretty vocal in saying that <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1366-a-radical-idea-charge-people-for-your-product">you have to charge for your product</a>. That works pretty well for the small-business collaboration and project management software that 37signals makes. But it doesn't work as well the smaller the app is. On the iPhone, you can sell <a href="http://www.taptaptap.com/#convert">a nifty unit converter</a> for $0.99. On the web? Not a chance. <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/searchtips/#unitconversion">Google does it for free</a>, as do countless other sites. Even if you have the best unit converter on the entire Internet that you spent weeks on developing and doing usability studies and designing gorgeous graphics for. The Internet just doesn't sell web apps in that price range. You come across as a greedy jerk, even if you have a great product.
</p><p>
Can that be changed? Can we make it so that nifty bite-size web apps can be sold for a buck or two? How do you change it? Well, here are my guesses as to what you'd have to change:
<ul>
	<li>Safer and faster payment system. People hate putting in credit card information on some unknown website. They'd rather just pass than take the risk for a small app that isn't such a big deal after all.</li>
	<li>Sense of ownership. A Tetris bookmark on a toolbar doesn't feel like a product. It feels the same as all the free Tetris apps out there.</li>
	<li>Pay once. Periodic billing doesn't make sense for small apps. What is the periodic equivalent of a $0.99? $0.05 / month? It's silly. But still, not a lot of webapps work on a pay-once system. Why not? Well, at that price point, wouldn't it be easier to just throw some ads on there? A pay-once model for apps should be simpler to set up.</li>
</ul>
I think the Chrome Web Store is an attempt to fix these problems. You buy apps quickly and safely through Google, you get a <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/apps/docs/index.html">nifty apps tray in Chrome</a> that makes it feel like you actually own something tangible, and you only pay once.
</p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-890" title="Chrome Apps Tray" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/tabstrip-apps.png" alt="Screen shot of Chrome's upcoming apps tray" width="584" height="84" />
<p>
I don't think that the Chrome Web Store is the future of web application development. On the other hand, I do think Google's efforts will make it more acceptable to make money by selling your web apps instead of by tacking on ads. Once people get used to the idea of buying access to a tic-tac-toe website, web developers will have an easier time selling such apps outside of Google's ecosystem. And that's great.
</p><p>
It makes me wonder what Google's perspective is on this. They're an ad empire, and here is their product supporting a different revenue model. Are they worried about what the web would be like without ads, or even, without Google? Would Google start charging for their own apps if things went this direction? You have to evolve to survive on the web, and maybe even Google needs a plan for survival.
</p><p>
I'm currently developing <a href="http://startcontinue.com/">a game using HTML5 technologies</a>. I always knew I'd never put ads on it, so I assumed it'd just always be free. Though now I have to wonder. Can I sell it for a buck? It's starting to look like it might be an interesting experiment.

  <h2 class="title"><a href="/2010/05/06/uploading-large-files-in-ruby-on-rails.html">Uploading Large Files in Ruby on Rails</a></h2> 
<div class="post post-/2010/05/06/uploading-large-files-in-ruby-on-rails">
  <div class="entrybody">
    <p>
File upload is a common feature for web sites, yet for some reason a lot of frameworks make it hard on you. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Faces">JSF</a> doesn't even support it by default; it requires the installation of additional libraries.
</p><p>
In Ruby on Rails it worked pretty well out of the box, but with a catch. File uploads are stored in memory, so if you are letting users upload large files, the server will quickly run out of memory.
</p><p>
To solve this I discovered a new (as of 2.3) component of Rails called <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/12/17/introducing-rails-metal">Metal</a>. Metal is a thin wrapper around <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/">Rack</a>, a minimal piece of middleware that handles HTTP requests for Rails. While Metal is a part of Rails, it lets you bypass Rails for the most part, and work at a lower level for those performance-critical bits. Happily, Metal lets you grab an uploaded file without making a copy of it in memory.
</p><p>
Here is an example of a Metal class that does file upload. To test this you'd just need to throw it in a <em>/app/metal</em> directory for your Rails project, then navigate to <em>http://example.com/uploadtest</em> to try it out.

  <h2 class="title"><a href="/2010/04/27/eating-alone.html">Eating Alone</a></h2> 
<div class="post post-/2010/04/27/eating-alone">
  <div class="entrybody">
    <a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/reuben-sandwich.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-839" title="Reuben Sandwich" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/reuben-sandwich-300x199.jpg" alt="Photo of a Reuben sandwich" width="300" height="199" /></a>
<p>
Have you ever been to a restaurant by yourself? Taco Bell doesn't count. Somebody asked you "How many people in your party?" and you said "One."
</p><p>
Let's say I'm walking home from work and I want a hot tasty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_sandwich">Reuben</a>. I can go to the grocery store, buy the ingredients, assemble the sandwich, heat up the griddle, and make it myself. But why should I? There are probably at least 10 places I walk past on my way home from work that serve this sandwich. I've decided to have dinner out.
</p><p>
But alas, I'm alone. I could call a few friends and see who is up for dinner, but I'm too hungry to wait, and quite frankly, maybe I just want to stare into space and daydream while I eat. I do it all day at work, why mess with success?
</p>
Given that I'm on my own, there are only a few types of places where I can go.
<h2>Go casual</h2>
If an eatery is sufficiently casual then eating alone there may not be a <em>faux pas</em>. How much the casual venue affects your ability to enjoy the meal depends on what you're after. My bases are covered if I want a deli sandwich or a Double Quarter Pounder with cheese. If I want rare filet mignon with seared asparagus and Gorgonzola mashed potatoes, this option won't help me.
<h2>At the bar</h2>
Due to the stigma surrounding drinking alone, you have to be careful here. It's hard to explain exactly when this is acceptable. There are some bars that just feel more comfortable for eating by yourself. The staff may or may not be amenable to your behavior. If the bar is empty, you just look depressing. If the bar is full, you're getting in the way when people are trying to order another round of Michelob Ultras. Sometimes when I intend to eat by myself I'll walk past a few bars to try to find one where I feel like I'd be comfortable.
<h2>Takeout</h2>
I've found that you can get takeout from pretty much anywhere. Delivery is a major service for a venue to offer, but pick-up doesn't inconvenience most venues in any way, so they seem happy to oblige. Though readily accessible, this option has more downs than ups. Your food may be cold by the time you get around to eating it, you won't get to enjoy the restaurant's ambiance, and it's difficult to time the pickup.
<p>
OK, so there are options. But why the rigmarole? Why is it socially unacceptable to go to dinner by yourself? I guess I can see a few possibilities...
</p>
<h2>The Venues</h2>
Maybe guests by their lonesome just aren't lucrative enough. A duo can split an appetizer and a bottle of wine, but a single guest is generally limited to a single drink and entrée. Then again, are solo eaters really discouraged by the venues proper? I haven't tried to go to a fancy restaurant by myself. What would happen?
<h2>Personal Appearance</h2>
Maybe people are just self-conscious about being alone. Restaurants are a place for people to go and enjoy themselves. What is better than enjoying a nice hot meal and a few drinks with some friends? Why <em>wouldn't</em> you bring a few buddies? That person at the table alone, playing Scrabble against the computer on their iPhone, what's their problem? No friends? Are they so obnoxious/ridden with body odor that they... <em>have no friends</em>?
<p>
In any case, let's fix this. Go to a restaurant by yourself. Order the <em>duckling à l'orange</em> and a stiff martini and treat yourself right. If we all do it, it's no longer socially unacceptable. So, folks: get on it.

<p>
Do you use your keyboard's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key">Menu key</a>? The one with a picture of a menu and a cursor. All it does is bring up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_menu">context menu</a>. It was introduced at the same time as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_key">Windows key</a> but didn't get the same press, probably because its effect couldn't compare to the indignity of having a Windows logo affixed to nigh every computer user's keyboard, their choice of OS notwithstanding.
</p><p>
What good is this thing in practice? For awhile I figured this would be an awesome way to correct typos while typing, since the context menu has corrections. Mistype, menu key, enter, keep typing. But alas, spell checkers notice misspellings after the word has lost focus, so the Menu key isn't really practical for this use.
</p><p>
So what is this thing for? Does anyone use their Menu key? Was it just another button to add to already-overcrowded keyboards along with the overwhelmingly useful ones like "open web browser" and "shut down"? Maybe that's why the delightfully simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apple-wireless-keyboard-aluminum-2007.jpg">Apple keyboards</a> don't have it?

<div class="post post-/2010/03/31/the-greatest-outfit">
  <div class="entrybody">
    Today I asked myself a question that every man must ask himself once in awhile. If I were to buy a sweet outfit on the Internet, and money was no object, what would I buy? Here is my answer to that question.
<h2>Balmain Shirt</h2>
<a class="imgLink" href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Balmain-shirt-1625.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-769" title="Balmain shirt 1625" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Balmain-shirt-1625-200x300.jpg" alt="A torn up shirt" width="200" height="300" /></a>
<p>$1625</p>

Honestly this part is going to be covered up so it's just for comfort. The ventilation is what makes it.
<h2>Dsquared Shorts</h2>
<a class="imgLink" href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/dsquare-shorts-555.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-770" title="dsquare shorts 555" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/dsquare-shorts-555-174x300.png" alt="Boxer denim short things" width="174" height="300" /></a>
<p>$555</p>

Denim shorts have long been a bold way of saying "I give up" but Dsquared is bringing them back. The fix? Turn them into 90% boxers.

<p>
When I threw out my last printer, I didn't realize that it would be my last. I had it in the back of my mind that I would eventually replace it. This was years ago. It has finally dawned on me that I'll never own a printer again. Printers have become obsolete for me, and I didn't even notice.
</p><p>
For awhile I'd have an occasional a panic: Oh crap! I need to print these concert tickets. Well, maybe I can just show them the confirmation email on my phone. Yep, it works. Anyone who requires physical tickets will mail them to you.
</p><p>
Oh no! I have to print tickets for my flight tomorrow. Nope. Swipe your credit card at the kiosk and your boarding passes are spat out instantly.
</p><p>
Every time I thought I needed a printer, I was wrong. Clearly things are only going to get more digital from here on out, so I don't think this is going to change.  Sure, some printers must exist. The world isn't done with them yet. But I sure am.
</p><p>
I'll call this post my eulogy for the home printer. My first printer, affectionately known as "The Blizzard," printed out many a fine computer science homework assignment for me. Well, I could have just printed them in the lab, but still. It was fun while it lasted.

Robert Biswas-Diener wrote <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/worklife/02/16/o.procrastinator.or.incubator/index.html?hpt=Mid">an article on CNN</a> coining the term "incubator" for people who seem like procrastinators but are actually a different breed. I felt that this article described my own work habits perfectly.
</p><p>
Incubators have a clear sense of deadlines, gets things done on time, and produce quality work. Before performing an important task, such as writing a term paper, they engage in an incubation phase that is necessary for their process. It looks like slacking off, but their mind is constantly brewing, preparing information for the outpouring of effort to come.
</p><p>
I always knew that I work this way, and that other people are like me. What I like about this article, though, is that Robert decided to give a name to it. From the article:
</p>
<blockquote>For most incubators, having a label that is less pejorative than "procrastinator" can be a breath of fresh air.</blockquote>

<div class="post post-/2010/02/11/buzz-makes-waves">
  <div class="entrybody">
    <a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/gbuzz.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-717" title="Google Buzz" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/gbuzz.png" alt="The Google Buzz logo" width="286" height="68" /></a>
<p>
Google just introduced a new product called <a href="http://google.com/buzz">Buzz</a>. I'll save you a lengthy explanation of the service since you've probably already heard it, but basically it is a status tool like <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> with better media and service integration.
</p><p>
It feels like this is a long time coming, due to the popularity of Twitter and the existence of another competitor's<a href="http://buzz.yahoo.com/"> similar product with the same name</a>. But this move seems to have confused a few people. What does this mean for <a href="https://wave.google.com/wave/">Wave</a>?
</p><p>
While I've heard some opinions that Buzz is the replacement for a failed Wave, I think the opposite is true. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=wave+replace+email&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">Displacing email with Wave</a> is a long-term strategy for a daunting task. Further, Wave is still being developed and is only in the "preview" phase. It is too soon to judge its success.
</p>
<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/a-pretty-wave.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-719" title="a pretty wave" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/a-pretty-wave-293x300.jpg" alt="A picture of a wave. An actual wave, not a web service." width="234" height="240" /></a>
<p>
Buzz seems to be more of a transition than a replacement. Completely switching from email (even Gmail) to Wave is nearly impossible in a world so reliant on email to do, well, everything. Buzz, on the other hand, does a better job sitting alongside email (quite literally) as an enhancement. It doesn't replace email, it expands it to do a lot of what Wave does.
</p><p>
More people will adopt Buzz than Wave at this point in the game, and it will nicely teach them the new communication model. Wave won't seem so foreign anymore. And don't be surprised if you see Buzz integrated into Wave too. Switching to Wave will be much easier if many of your existing conversations come along with you.
</p><p>
I'm very interested in seeing how this plays out, since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email#Problems">email is badly broken</a> and it is time for the Internet to get an upgrade.
