I have no doubt that they are documented out there somewhere, but I'm not much for reading manuals, I confess.
<h2>Double-press the menu button</h2>
This does one of two things, depending on the context.

<em>iPhone locked:</em> This will bring up iPod controls.  The touch screen will now let you pause, play, skip, etc.

<em>iPhone unlocked, music playing:</em> Same as above

<em>iPhone unlocked, no music playing:</em> Takes you to the "Favorites" list to make a call.
<h2><strong>Horizontal swipe</strong></h2>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
In some lists, such as your inbox, swiping from right to left or left to right over an item this will bring up the option to delete the item you swiped over.  Barely faster than other methods, but I have started using it when convenient.
<h2>Maps zoom vs. Safari zoom</h2>
You probably already know that in the browser you can double-tap to zoom in on a section of the page, then do it again to zoom out.  In the Maps application, things work a little differently.  Here you can double-tap (tap twice in a row quickly) to zoom in, but to zoom out you tap with both fingers at once (can't call this double-tapping too, do we have a more terse lingo for the two-finger-tap yet?)
