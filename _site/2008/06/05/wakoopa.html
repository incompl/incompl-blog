          Being a web developer (and <a title="TechCrunch" href="http://techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a> reader) I end up trying a whole lot of web apps.  Some of them are very cool, but few are so cool that I actually end up using them.

Recently <a title="Wakoopa" href="http://wakoopa.com">Wakoopa</a> managed to sneak into my "cool enough to keep" list.  Aside from sounding like a Super Mario Bros. enemy, and having a stylish white, gray, black, neon green, and neon pink theme, Wakoopa is basically <a title="Last.fm" href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> for desktop apps.  You install a service (Mac or PC) that reports which of your applications receive the most of your attention.  Here is what I have been using for the last few days:

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/wakoopa_pie.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-11" title="wakoopa_pie" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/wakoopa_pie-300x174.png" alt="" width="300" height="174" /></a>

I guess it isn't very interesting that I mostly just use my web browser (<a title="Opera" href="http://opera.com">Opera</a> is great, by the way), which makes you immediately wonder if this should be a way of tracking which web sites you visit.  But the usefulness isn't in seeing your own habits.

The first interesting use is in discovering new applications.  Just perusing the categorized and tagged lists of apps, ordered by popularity, is a great way to discover tools and time-wasters alike.

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/wakoopa_tags.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12" title="wakoopa_tags" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/wakoopa_tags-297x300.png" alt="" width="297" height="300" /></a>

This screen shot shows a few things.  First, that the first couple results aren't very interesting.  Second, that they are not 100% accurate (unless there are some masochists doing their text-editing in Photoshop out there).  but third, we see some very popular applications that aren't so well known.  I haven't heard of a couple of these, but immediately I feel the need to go figure out what makes them so popular.  That is really the core of the Wakoopa product.

Aside from discovery, Wakoopa has another interesting use.  A friend of mine recently bought a Macbook and asked me what all the fun apps for it are.  I named a few (<a title="Adium" href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a>, <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>, <a href="http://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a>), then realized that I could link them to my Wakoopa profile to show them what I actually used.  They found this pretty helpful.  In short, Wakoopa seems like an efficient way to share with friends what applications you find useful, and I'm sure I'd be interested in seeing the same about people I know.

I recommend giving this site a try.  I don't have any Wakoopa contacts yet, so if you do, feel free to add <a title="My profile on Wakoopa" href="http://wakoopa.com/gsmith">me</a>.
