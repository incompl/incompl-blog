          As an <a title="Opera" href="http://opera.com">Opera</a> user, I was one of the few people excited about their recent 9.5 release.  Overall it is a good release, though I'm going to start with the bad news first in a second.  I'm going to discuss things from my perspective rather than cover all the features in the change log one by one, so your mileage may vary.

The new UI design initially got the thumbs up from me, because I love dark and sleek, but it turns out the usability is not so impressive.  Removing all the icon colors makes them less recognizable, the tab close buttons are smaller and harder to click, and the new tab button defaults to the right of the tabs, where its location continuously changes as tabs are added or removed.  This can all be changed by the user, and in my mind, must be.  As pretty as the dark icons look at a casual glance, this is not a change for the better.  It looks like a lot of these changes were meant to look good in Vista.  The previous default theme wasn't OS-specific though, which I think is a better approach.  Also, Opera said that the new tab button to the right of the tabs would be familiar to IE users.  It is OK to make changes to ease the transition for new users, but you should only do so when you're not harming your own product.  Microsoft, well, isn't the best group to look to when it comes to UI design. The original theme, which you can still get for Opera 9.5, has clean blue tabs, soft grays, and occasional pale yellow highlights.  I have the feeling Opera will bring this back, or try something very different for their next major release.

On the bright side, my favorite features are still here, occasionally with subtle improvements.  The ability to make a search out of any form field, the tab trash can, the way it opens with my tabs from last time, are all great.  I know Firefox has since adopted some of these features, but I still get the feeling Opera is paving the new ground with these little niceties.

I am the only person I know of who likes Opera's mail client, but sadly the previous release had a bug that made me unable to read emails from a certain other person.  This was a deal breaker, and I had been using Thunderbird until this release.  The bug is now fixed, and I now have a good feeling of Opera vs. Thunderbird for a mail client.  Thunderbird seems, well, a little lame.  I prefer Opera's Search Don't Sort mentality, which GMail has already proven to me to be the superior method of mail organization over folders and filing.  Opera mail's search is damned fast.  I did the same search in Opera and Thunderbird over about 20,000 messages.  Opera found it in about a second, Thunderbird took maybe 20 seconds.  It is kind of a requirement for this mail paradigm, but is probably something any Thunderbird user would appreciate.

That isn't the only fast thing in Opera.  It just feels fast in general.  Some of the benchmarks I've seen seem to support this feeling.  The trade-off seems to be that about once a month Opera falls flat on its face and dies.  Well, I haven't used Firefox or Internet Explorer enough lately to know if this is more or less often than those browsers.  But it isn't a big deal:  Opera comes right back up in the same state I left it.

My beef with the new theme and icon set doesn't reach every corner of the usability picture.  There are some smart changes too.  The left panel that carries default panels like mail, contacts, history, page information, and so on is now opened and closed by a button on the tool bar rather than a narrow strip along the side of the browser.  Much better.  Apparently new panels can be downloaded and added, but I haven't felt the need.

Another feature worth mentioning is "Opera Link", which synchronizes your settings and bookmarks between installations of Opera.  I believe Firefox plug-ins that do this have abounded lately, so it's nice to finally have that feature in Opera.  My bookmark list is much more interesting and useful than it used to be, as I never really settled on any bookmarking service like del.icio.us.

Overall I'm happy with what I got.  The new major features are great, there are some little tweaks here and there, the funky theme is surmountable with their peachy theme chooser, and I still feel a a little pang of joy when my browser treats a torrent link as a regular download, along with my normal downloads.  It's surprising that only <a title="Browser Stats" href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp">1.4%</a> of people that use this thing.  Maybe it is because Opera focuses so much on the mobile world, and interesting contracts like <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/devices/nintendo/">Opera for Wii</a>.  Probably the lack of a massive operating system that installs you by default, or an amazingly devout Free software community.  In any case, I like what I got with this release.
