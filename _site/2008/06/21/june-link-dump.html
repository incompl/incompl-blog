          <a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/8.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-28" title="Fat Squirrel" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/8-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>First, thanks to <a href="http://www.malevolent.com/weblog/">Matt Round</a> who inspired me to do dumps in this format, and whose blog is fantastic.

Here is some straight-talking about <a href="http://www.friday.com/bbum/2008/06/19/what-is-good-tequila/">what makes good tequila</a>.  I always found that there is some good, subtle, tasty tequilas out there, but now I know what makes them different.  I personally enjoy the very aged, woody types.

About as functional as your common music player's visualizer, but <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1130828">this one visualizes the Eclipse commit history</a>.

I'm usually pretty hard on time elapse pictures of urban transportation (what could be more trite in photography nowadays?), but this fellow proved that <a href="http://utoks.deviantart.com/art/Dupont-Circle-Stn-Dual-WP-30337023">it can still be done in an interesting way</a>.

<a href="http://orange.blender.org/">Elephant's Dream</a>, which 2 years ago billed itself as the first "Open" movie, was written with free tools such as <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> and is licensed under Creative Commons.  It is a fairly enjoyable 11-minute journey of two odd fellows in a beautiful but sinister machine world.

Here is a picture of <a href="http://pixdaus.com/pics/1213813630zMmkkYv.jpg">Venus passing in front of the sun</a>.  Sometimes astronomical pictures give me a sense of awe that nothing else really can.

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/squirrelfish.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-26" title="SquirrelFish Logo" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/squirrelfish.png" alt="" width="216" height="135" /></a><a href="http://webkit.org/blog/189/announcing-squirrelfish/">SquirrelFish</a>.  Everyone should look to these folks next time they need inspiration for naming their JavaScript interpreter.  And the logo?  Spectacular.

The Slashdot era was about news without writers, only editors.  The Digg era was about news with just users.  Next, <a href="http://twitturly.com/">Twitturly</a> shows us that all you need is the algorithm.  An excellent use of <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>'s latent "What people are talking about" data.

<a href="http://www.uncrate.com/">Uncrate</a> is "The Buyer's Guide for Men" but it is better described as "Badass product you know you want every day."

<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/hot-coffee-chewsman-1.gif"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-27" title="Ginger People person" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/hot-coffee-chewsman-1.gif" alt="" width="175" height="105" /></a>Not only does <a href="http://www.gingerpeople.com/">Ginger People</a>'s candy have that perfect sweet-hot ginger taste, but their ginger people art is unforgettably charming.  I haven't seen their ginger beer in stores, but I love their other products and the noble <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_%27N%27_Stormy">dark and stormy</a> enough that I plan on ordering some.

<a href="http://www.guessthelogo.com/">A quiz</a> that shows how well you remember the logos that you see every day.

And to end on a pointless note, here are some <a href="http://www.visual-assault.org/ssd_admin/albums/album-41/lg/6405.jpg">dog speeders</a>.
