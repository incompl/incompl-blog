          Programming is definitely a skill, but its sub-skills are a little fuzzier.  It is often broken down by language.  You have programmers who are good at Java, or C, or Smalltalk, or Self, or JavaScript, or whatever.  This is useful to know, but it is not the whole picture.

To me, this is like breaking down "people who are good at cars" as people who are good at Mitsubishis, or Fords, or Hondas, or Lamborghinis, or Caterpillars.  In reality, you also need to know who is good at racing, construction, manual transmission, driving in snow, and so on.  Someone who drives Mitsubishis might know how to fix their cup holders, so it is good to know who is good with that make of vehicle, but again, that isn't the whole picture.

This can cause trouble.  Your average software developer resume doesn't tell you if the person is good at pointer arithmetic, or higher-order functions, or prototypal OOP, and so on.  You often have to infer it from the language list, and honestly that process is not as fail-proof as it seems.  Many people who know JavaScript don't even know what prototypal OOP is.  I'm not sure how many people who know C are pointer arithmetic wizards.  You can make an educated guess, but I hate guessing, and I'd do a bad job guessing the specific skills of someone whose primary language is C++, as C++ just involves so much stuff.  I love resumes that go deeper, and appreciate the ones I've seen.

We also don't hear much about the groupings of these sub-skills.  We all know that a fellow who implements operating systems in C and a fellow who develops blog software in Ruby have very, very different skill sets.  But we don't talk about system skills and implementation skills as much as we talk about system languages and implementation languages.

It is harder to write a resume that says "I am good with higher-order functions and closures" rather one that simply says "I am good with Lisp" and leaves the rest implicit.  But that is the direction I think we should move in.  Far too often I have no idea what kind of programmer is behind a resume until the interview, which can lead to a lot of wasted time.  I'd way rather hear that real programmers can think in pointers than hear that real programmers use C.  And in general, I'd like to have an easier time communicating with people about types of programmers and their various skills.
