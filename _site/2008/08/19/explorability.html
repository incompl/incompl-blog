          I've started considering <strong>explorability</strong> a metric of code quality.  Exploribility is how easily a programmer can follow code paths within the program when reading the source code.  Things that adversely effect explorability are often adversely impacting some other quality of the code.  On the other hand, many are perfectly acceptable when used correctly.

Here are some examples:

Side-effects (the reader may have difficulty making the leap from effect to cause, among the other problems with side-effects)

Using string values to control program flow (IDEs can't easily track them, for example enumerations are better in some cases)

Reflection / "eval"-type functions (Again, your IDE probably can't track this type of thing)

Line wrapping at bad times (Reduces effectiveness of IDE search functions, for example it can be bad to wrap in the middle of a file path)

Unnecessary String parsing (<em>foo = foo.replace("fresh", "funk")</em> when<em> foo = "icon_funk.gif"</em> is better, again effects usefulness of IDE search functions)

Sometimes explorability comes into conflict with other best-practices (in the previous example, the code may need to abstract away the file extension).  But it is definitely a good ideal to reach towards.
