      <h2>RPG Box Art: My Top 3</h2>

          Here are my top 3 favorite pieces of box art for console RPGs.
<h3>3: Final Fantasy IV DS (North America)</h3>
<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/ff4ds_ntsc_front.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85" title="Final Fantasy IV DS Cover (North American)" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/ff4ds_ntsc_front.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="445" /></a>

A newcomer.  Why?

The art style of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshitaka_Amano">Yoshitaka Amano</a>.  This piece demonstrates one of his signatures: some areas have high complexity, some areas are fairly plain.  I'm not actually sure if he designed this logo, but it is clearly in his style.

Perfect positioning.  A temptation might have been to ignore the ESRB and Square Enix text.  But in this case it was carefully considered.

Black.  Final Fantasy box art is usually light colored or white.  They decided to make this release stand out by making it as sinister as it is sleek.

Great use of foil.  You can't tell in the picture, but the logo is metallic.  Too many games make poor use of foil in their box art.  Some of them simply make the whole box semi-metallic, only succeeding in making it hard to read.  If you own this game or see the box in the store, take a moment to appreciate how the use of foil is sharp and clean, but matte enough to avoid being distracting.
<h3>2: Breath of Fire III</h3>
<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/cover-front.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-86" title="Breath of Fire III Cover" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/cover-front.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a>

Also dark and simple.  Why?

Realistic fire.  This will really stand out in a rack of games sporting CGI renders.

Use of symmetry.  This is well balanced, but the fact that the vertically-centered line (the sword and the i) are only subtly indicating the center of the image is what takes the cake.

The i.  They ignored the temptation to go bad-ass all the way.  The candle is subtle, thoughtful, and well-executed.  Notice the yellow glow around the candle flame.  That wouldn't work except against the black of the sword.

This box art falls short though.  The "The Classic Role Playing Game" text is white on light orange on the left side.  This is sloppy.  My guess is that this got tacked on after the real designer's job was done.
<h3>1: Final Fantasy VII (Japan)</h3>
<a href="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/ff7_jap.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-87" title="Final Fantasy VII Box Art" src="http://incompl.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/ff7_jap.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="423" /></a>

Lots of white.  Why?

In Japan, the title could sell this game, given the circumstances.  The designer knew this and decided that this was more than any flashy artwork could do.

The font.  This is the first Final Fantasy cover to use this logo style, to my knowledge, and it has been used ever since.  A brilliant example of how to make a fantasy font look distinguished.

Off-center. The logo isn't presenting itself as the center of attention, neither in size, nor in position.  It is simply there.

The logo background image.  In this version it isn't clear that this is a meteor, so it gains meaning as you play.  A fantastic symbol for the game (on several levels) with a stylish fade.
