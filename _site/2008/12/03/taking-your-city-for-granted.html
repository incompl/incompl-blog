I found the information actually pretty unhelpful as an actual Boston resident. Â So, for my fellow Bostonfolk, here are some additional notes to make the list a bit more useful.

1 ) Harbor Cruise: Skip if it isn't a booze cruise.

2 ) Museum of Science: Only if you're nine years old.

3 ) Walk through Beacon Hill: Walking up hills sucks, just go have dinner on Charles St.

4 ) Show at the Wang: Only if it is a concert, and bring 10s for the bar.

5 ) Walk down Newbury: And buy clothes and eat dinner. Repeat once or twice a month.

6 ) Cappuccino in a North End Cafe: Or get pissed that there is no parking and do something else.

8 ) Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum: If your family is visiting.

9 ) Skywalk Observatory: If someone from outside the country is visiting.

10 ) See the Skyline from a Bridge: If you don't already see it twice a day while commuting.
