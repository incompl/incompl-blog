          Some of the simple lessons I've learned lately.
<ul>
	<li>Software features are a waste of time if you haven't released your software yet.  Not exaggerating.  Literally a waste of time.</li>
	<li>Cultural connotations don't go away when you ignore them.  You can't reason with them.  If a cultural connotation is disrupting the effect of something you're doing, steer clear.  You can't beat society.</li>
	<li>Sometimes you need a case of Red Bull, a couple Pizza deliveries, and a weekend of being a shut-in if you want to be a productive programmer outside of your job.</li>
	<li>Good ideas are easy to come by.  Most of them aren't plausible for you, personally.  Choose carefully.</li>
</ul>
