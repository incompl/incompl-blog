          I've been noticing websites using patterned backgrounds again.  This is a trend that died pretty early, but the resurrection has been tasteful thus far.  <a href="http://www.inviteshare.com/">InviteShare</a> is one site that pushes on the idea hard, takes risks, and pulls it off.  I love the black translucent parts contrasted with the orange translucent parts.  Also, intricate, flowery patterns look great in dark gray on black.  My favorite dress shirt is dark gray on black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paisley_(design)">paisley</a>.

To experiment with the technique, I've put a pink skull pattern on this site.  It could use some tweaks, but I'm going to let it sink in for a bit before I decide what to do with it.

(Note: the site design has changed since this post)
