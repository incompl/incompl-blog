The subway doesn't really work this way, but <a href="http://bustedwonder.com/exterminus/">this surrealist comic</a> is fantastic.

This <a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1823766">video featuring the personifications of famous fonts</a> has been making its rounds on social news sites lately, but it is too good to leave out.

<a href="http://www.desteenation.com/"></a><a href="http://www.desteenation.com/">Destee Nation Shirt Company</a> has an enticing slogan: "Real shirts from real places."  Great products, and totally feeds my need to have unique stuff.
